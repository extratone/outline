long-running &#x201C;saddest rich person&#x201D; contest by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/12/21062584/spacex-yusaku-maezawa-japan-billionaire-starship-girlfriend-contest-moon">announcing that he was looking for a girlfriend go to to the moon with him</a>. To find his Moon Love, Maezawa will be holding a contest that <a href="https://mz.abema.tv/en.html">will be filmed as part of a &#x201C;serious matchmaking documentary&#x201D;</a>. (DON&#x2019;T laugh; everyone is deserving of love.) For more details, please refer to this screenshot from the documentary&#x2019;s website:</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20200114-PlQdl0tG0eRZrBTv5EOi?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=5bfa6d55d75f79fa38fc04c8b9dce520" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20200114-PlQdl0tG0eRZrBTv5EOi?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=260f73055edcbd93aff705d49ac6320a 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20200114-PlQdl0tG0eRZrBTv5EOi?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=2ae5c6331e3f69e8a805a077d02e1e9d 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"><span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Image via <a href="https://mz.abema.tv/en.html">Abema TV</a></span></p></div><p>While I think that basically all of us out there &#x201C;want to enjoy life to the fullest&#x201D; and hope &#x201C;for world peace,&#x201D; how many people other than Maezawa actually want to go to the moon?</p><div class="z9" data-id="qAtSfbbk"></div><p>The answer is: Not as many as you might think (unless you thought not many people actually want to go to the moon). Only 43 percent of those surveyed in a <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/science/articles-reports/2019/07/20/half-britons-wouldnt-want-go-moon-even-if-their-sa?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website_article&amp;utm_campaign=moon">recent poll conducted by the British firm YouGov</a> said they were interested in personally going to the moon. Forty-eight percent said they would <em>not</em> go to the moon. As to why people didn&#x2019;t want to go to the moon, 23 percent said that they just weren&#x2019;t interested, while roughly the same amount of people indicated they thought there was &#x201C;not enough to see or do on the moon&#x201D; or that they&#x2019;d rather go somewhere on Earth. Nine percent of the non-mooners &#x201C;reject[ed the] premise that safe return could be guaranteed.&#x201D;</p><p>To which I say, what the hell is wrong with those people? Assuming that the moon actually exists, I would go to it so hard.</p><p>Clearly, the people who participated in YouGov&#x2019;s moon poll do not want to bring joy into their lives. So, I conducted my own poll about the moon in which I simply asked a bunch of people if they wanted to go to the moon (plus a few other things).

You would have the opportunity to experience weightlessness on the way there (tight) and the apparently life-changing experience of seeing the earth from a great distance (very tight). You could probably post one of those on Instagram with the caption, &#x201C;Um we live here now?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>What would be the scariest thing about going there?</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;d be worried about my spacesuit leaking and my blood boiling or whatever supposedly happens to you when you die in space. Taking a flight is safe, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&apos;t contemplate the possibility that I&apos;ll die every time I do that. I figure this would be heightened on the moon, which is covered in craters from the impact of flying space rocks. A little one of those hits your spacesuit?

I feel like going to the moon is a real test of character: if you are able to absorb the full weight and meaning of being on the moon as it is happening, it means you are a good and powerful person. If on the other hand you feel bored for two seconds, or even slightly underwhelmed, or wish you were somewhere else, it means there is no hope for you.

I would like to see the stars from a different angle, and look a completely different kind of landscape. And while I don&#x2019;t like the idea of the moon being an &#x201C;exclusive&#x201D; thing, I do like the idea of getting to go somewhere that people have dreamed about going to for so long.</p><p><strong>Who would you pick to accompany you?</strong></p><p>I might want to go with my sister, because she would definitely be into the whole &#x201C;spiritual&#x201D; part of the moon and would really appreciate that aspect of it. But also, if we got on each other&#x2018;s nerves there isn&#x2019;t really any way that we could escape from each other for a few hours without it being really dangerous, so maybe I would just want to bring one of my cats (Milo, Theo, and Basil) instead. Milo would barely notice he was there, Theo would just want to stay close to his mom and cuddle the whole time, Basil would probably want to explore and will probably have the most fun, but he&#x2019;s really [my sister] Anna&#x2019;s cat.</p><p>I might also want to go with one of my brothers, because he studied earth and planetary sciences. He could explain the rock formations to me. It would kind of be like when we went to Napa and he explained to me a bunch of things about how the grapes were grown for wine.
