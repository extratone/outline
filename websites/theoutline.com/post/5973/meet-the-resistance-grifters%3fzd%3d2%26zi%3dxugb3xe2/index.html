An unending tsunami of bad news has resulted in many left-of-center types casting about for the answer to this seemingly never-ending political nightmare.</p><p>One place where this desperation is most acutely felt is in the self-styled &quot;Resistance,&quot; a collection of liberal activists typically from the Obama and Clinton coalitions who have banded together to push back against the Trump agenda, mostly on Twitter. But in that collection of people are a number of desperate individuals who only want the Trump administration to end so they can seize power. Sensing weakness, these grifters have taken advantage of that desperation and are profiting off of liberal misery and hope. This group includes everyone from laughable con artists to social-media conspiracy theorists to conservatives on the reinvention circuit. Here are the ones to know.</p><h2 class="h2">10.
