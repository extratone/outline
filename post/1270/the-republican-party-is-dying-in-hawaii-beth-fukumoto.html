She was supposed to shoot a video the next morning announcing her decision to leave the Republican Party, but she postponed the recording three times. &#x201C;Making the decision was rough,&#x201D; she wrote, &#x201C;but it&#x2019;s turning out that explaining it in 3 mins is damn near impossible.&#x201D;</p><div class="youtube-embed" data-type="full"><div class="youtube-embed__video"><div class="youtube-embed__video__wrapper"><div class="youtube-embed__video__element"><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wNcWAb9n9c?enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div></div><p>Fukumoto, 33, is the state representative for Hawaii&#x2019;s District 36, which includes the wealthy Honolulu suburb of Mililani. Until recently, she was the leader of Hawaii&#x2019;s small Republican caucus and a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/40-under-40/#beth-fukumoto">rising star</a> in the national party.</p><div class="z9" data-id="akA797lr"></div><p>But in January, Fukumoto made a speech at the Women&#x2019;s March in Oahu criticizing President Donald Trump for his treatment of racial and religious minorities and women &#x2014; the final straw for three of her hardline Republican colleagues, who were sick of what they saw as her repeated subversion of the party. She was told that if she didn&#x2019;t stop criticizing Trump, she would be removed from her position as Minority Leader. When she refused, she was ousted in an ugly closed-door vote that reportedly caused one of her colleagues to <a href="http://www.kitv.com/story/34406341/rep-beth-fukumoto-beat-up-by-her-party-may-defect">leave the floor in tears</a>.</p><p>Fukumoto had joined the Hawaii GOP thinking it could restyle itself to appeal more to young people and minorities. Instead, she found that the party was only growing more intolerant &#x2014; and Trump&#x2019;s divisive rhetoric was making things worse. On the same day she was voted out as Minority Leader, Fukumoto announced she wanted to switch parties and asked her constituents to weigh in.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Fukumoto in her apartment in Mililani, Hawaii." class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-onUh6skXkB03VdOtjefZ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=016c116d65e2b9e89e28a266706bc2d4" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-onUh6skXkB03VdOtjefZ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=6f2bd081d8171b956f6957e7458bf61d 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-onUh6skXkB03VdOtjefZ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=91db98d295fd495d5618ada1dd71706e 2000w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-onUh6skXkB03VdOtjefZ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=3000&amp;s=c01bdac81844e758131b075a7d2748f2 3000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Fukumoto in her apartment in Mililani, Hawaii. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Jordan Oplinger / The Outline</span></p></div><div class="z9" data-id="jeCtprap"></div><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t see a way forward anymore,&#x201D; she told me. &#x201C;I do think that someday these things might change. But right now, in this America and in this state, my values and what I&#x2019;m most concerned about are things that Democrats are paying attention to and not things that Republicans are paying attention to.&#x201D;</p><p>The combination of her ouster and potential party switch made national news.

Out of the 477 who wrote, called, or emailed, 123 said she should leave, 220 said they didn&#x2019;t care, 111 said she should stay, and 19 said she should stay but they would still support her if she switched.

Her grandfather had escaped suspicion by gathering up all the Japanese artifacts in the house, burying them, and replacing them with an American flag and a Bible. As she spoke, she noticed a headline on the TV in the bar about how Trump had said he <a href="http://time.com/4140050/donald-trump-muslims-japanese-internment/">might have supported Japanese internment</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;It made it so real,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t not say something.

Cynthia Thielen, a fiscal conservative and environmental attorney who has served in the legislature since 1990, is now the only outspoken advocate for change in the Hawaii GOP.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Sarah Fukumoto, 29, left, is chief of staff for her sister Beth, 33." class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-Glqy0hS5ksRbXG4pjcrr?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=b5025c17598bf724f8306ce3ebfd5e9b" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-Glqy0hS5ksRbXG4pjcrr?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=061dae5ebaf2e2ed2a9af8c1909aad13 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-Glqy0hS5ksRbXG4pjcrr?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=ce5e57524e8b5725e678c4b7418a17a8 2000w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-Glqy0hS5ksRbXG4pjcrr?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=3000&amp;s=9dde641e9147c050216c32ee67c79c33 3000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Sarah Fukumoto, 29, left, is chief of staff for her sister Beth, 33. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Jordan Oplinger / The Outline</span></p></div><p>&#x201C;They took away the face of moderate Republicanism when they removed Beth as our minority leader,&#x201D; Thielen said. &#x201C;It signals the end of our Republican Party. Hawaii is a very tolerant, diverse society. And when you come in with a hard right-wing social conservatism, it&#x2019;s just not going to be accepted by the people.&#x201D;</p><p>Other local GOP officials maintain that Fukumoto was removed as leader not only because she spoke out against the president but because she failed to lead the struggling party. Tupola said she hopes to take the party in a new direction by focusing on recruiting new candidates, &#x201C;rallying the troops,&#x201D; and &#x201C;keeping the group together.&#x201D;</p><p>McDermott seemed most irked by the attention Fukumoto had gotten since her comments at the Women&#x2019;s March.</p><p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s not a victim, and she hasn&#x2019;t done anything as a legislator in her four years here aside from criticize Trump,&#x201D; McDermott told <em>The Outline</em>. &#x201C;She hasn&#x2019;t done jack squat, and she&#x2019;s milking this. She&#x2019;s in <em>Elle</em> magazine, you guys are coming out to cover her.

They caught a few hours of sleep, picked up breakfast from McDonald&#x2019;s, and headed to the state legislature &#x2014; a symmetrical, airy building that is designed to resemble a volcano. There they met up with Fukumoto&#x2019;s communications director and childhood friend, Chelsea Roy, set up a camera on the lawn, and loaded the speech into a teleprompter. Fukumoto, dressed in a dark blue suit, started working her way through the announcement.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you sure you want to keep this part?&#x201D; Sarah asked, referring to a section about how Fukumoto&#x2019;s Republican friends had already quit the party. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re definitely going to get criticism for that line.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to get criticism for this whole speech,&#x201D; Fukumoto said.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Chelsea Roy, Fukumoto&apos;s communications coordinator, adjusts the teleprompter while filming her announcement that she is switching to the Democratic Party." class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-zABMa52KaeWo4yVqAX16?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=3cf956e7e0faf5609578bd22209b2a72" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-zABMa52KaeWo4yVqAX16?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=91f5f0b3b72151bd5fc742d611d8c102 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-zABMa52KaeWo4yVqAX16?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=924feeefc1a09bb1aab7b6d3c11ff6d8 2000w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170322-zABMa52KaeWo4yVqAX16?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=3000&amp;s=51fbc559ed9e600d9e322d044dc793f5 3000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Chelsea Roy, Fukumoto&apos;s communications coordinator, adjusts the teleprompter while filming her announcement that she is switching to the Democratic Party. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Jordan Oplinger / The Outline</span></p></div><p>Sarah and the rest of Fukumoto&#x2019;s staff have no qualms with following their representative to the other side. They share her disgust with Trump, and most of them already lean liberal. Marlo Ting, Fukumoto&#x2019;s wonky legislative aide, told me he stopped identifying as a Republican when he saw the way the party reacted to Barack Obama. &#x201C;They started to glorify ignorance,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Like Fukumoto, he believes the Hawaii GOP doesn&#x2019;t want to save itself from ruin. &#x201C;As crazy as it sounds, they seem to be convinced that the best way to grow their party is to kick out everyone that doesn&apos;t think like certain people in that party,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s sort of a &#x2018;no true Scotsman&#x2019; fallacy.&#x201D;</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="7344483"><span>&#x201C;It signals the end of our Republican Party.&#x201D;</span></blockquote><p>In all likelihood, the Democrats will accept Fukumoto. It will no longer be considered blasphemous for her to say she thinks Trump is a dangerous bully. Unfortunately, fewer people will pay attention if it&#x2019;s just another Democrat criticizing the president &#x2014; and Fukumoto doubts that any Republicans will break ranks any time soon.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not optimistic that more people are going to start speaking out,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That people within the party haven&#x2019;t been willing to stand with me is probably the most disappointing thing of all.&#x201D;</p><div class="post-embed"><div class="post-embed__wrapper"><a class="post-embed__link"
