aria-label="Share via email"><span class="icon-mail"></span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="post__body"> <p><em>Mr. Personality</em>, which aired on Fox for a scant five weeks in 2003, was a show about a single woman choosing between 20 men to find the love of her life. That was the standard part, accompanied by two stranger details: All the men had to wear masks (okay, kinky, but not so weird), and it was hosted by a post-Clinton scandal Monica Lewinsky (excuse me, what?).</p><p>Produced during the height of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/07/reality-tv-golden-era">what some described</a> as reality televsion&#x2019;s &#x201C;golden era,&#x201D; <em>Mr. Personality</em>&#x2019;s premise was simple, if gimmicky: What if instead of judging romantic partners on their looks, they were judged solely on their personalities? Putting that into motion for a TV audience turned out to be a somewhat convoluted process. Like on <em>The Bachelor,</em> which premiered in 2002, <em>Mr. Personality</em> challenged one woman, obviously a beautiful one, to find the love of her life out of a selection of 20 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/03/20/show.lewinsky.reut/">&#x201C;average-looking,&#x201D;</a> mask-wearing men. The men had to wear their masks at all times, except for when they went with the woman to a special, dark room, where the man would remove his mask and the woman, hilariously, was allowed to feel his face. The men were also forbidden from revealing <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2003/04/monica_the_chaperone.html">their professions</a>.</p><p>Producers hoped that the presence of Lewinsky, who had found a living in selling handbags online, would set the show apart. If anything, it only exposed Lewinsky, who was 29 at the time, to even more public shaming. At the time, she was trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/arts/television-radio-telling-her-own-story-selling-her-new-self.html">rehabilitate her image</a>. The year before, she had appeared on an HBO special in which she fielded questions about her life, town-hall style. &#x201C;There, sitting casually on the edge of the stage in a black pantsuit, Ms. Lewinsky tries to project the image of a well-adjusted, forward-looking person, who was treated badly by Bill Clinton, Linda Tripp and the media,&#x201D; <em>The New York Times</em> wrote in a review of the show. &#x201C;She actually projects the image of an emotionally distraught person trapped by her past, who was treated badly by Bill Clinton, Linda Tripp and the media.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="2EIA0HvX"></div><div class="youtube-embed" data-type="full"><div class="youtube-embed__video"><div class="youtube-embed__video__wrapper"><div class="youtube-embed__video__element"><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkabRqtDjMw?enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div><p class="youtube-embed__caption"> A promo for *Mr. Personality*. <span class="youtube-embed__caption__byline">LostRealityTV / YouTube</span></p></div><p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the reaction to Lewinsky&#x2019;s role on <em>Mr. Personality</em> was roundly dismissive. &#x201C;If you were trying to put the past behind you and restore your good name, would you become a reality TV host?&#x201D; wrote Joanne Ostrow in <em>The Denver Post</em>. &#x201C;Ah, but you are not Monica Lewinsky.

In this brief oral history, <em>The Outline</em> spoke with casting directors Sheila Conlin and Katy Wallin, producer Scott Firestone, mask designer Tina Haatainen-Jones, and former contestant Brian Karalus. (Through a spokesperson, Monica Lewinsky declined to comment for this piece. <em>Mr. Personality</em> bachelorette Hayley Arp and winner William Dyck did not respond to request for comment.) Here&#x2019;s what some of those who know <em>Mr. Personality</em> best told me.</p><hr class="hr"><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="83182228"><span><strong>Sheila Conlin (casting director):</strong> It was like the race to see who&apos;s gonna get what show on the air first.

You judge based on what you&apos;re seeing. But how are you gonna really be able to pull this off and get to know someone with a mask over their face? I think my first question then was like, well what kind of mask? That&apos;s kind of creepy.

It sounds ridiculous. And to tell you the truth, I don&apos;t know if they used it or not. But they wanted me to hold the key for the chastity mask, and I was the only one that could get them out.

The potential dangers of all that reality had quickly revealed themselves: A year earlier, <em>Big Brother&#x2019;s</em> Justin Sebik became the first person to get kicked off of a reality show for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ1wXnvPTR4">holding a knife to a fellow contestant&#x2019;s neck</a>. <em>Mr. Personality</em> contestants were put through extensive medical and psychological evaluations, background checks, and STD tests as part of the vetting process.</p><p>The woman tasked with finding the love of her life on <em>Mr. Personality</em> was Hayley Arp, a 26-year-old <a href="http://ew.com/article/2003/04/21/we-answer-mr-personality-burning-questions/">stockbroker</a> from Atlanta. In an interview with the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> published on the day <em>Mr. Personality</em> premiered, Arp said that she was a fan of reality dating shows like <em>Joe Millionaire</em> and was connected to a casting director when a friend gave them her number. &#x201C;I was just so intrigued by it,&#x201D; she said of <em>Mr. Personality&#x2019;s</em> premise. &#x201C;Here was an opportunity to find 20 decent men who aren&apos;t criminals and don&apos;t have mental illnesses and are all good guys.&#x201D;</p><p>One of those guys was Brian Karalus, a criminal defense attorney from St. Paul.</p><hr class="hr"><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="96389745"><span><strong>Brian Karalus (contestant):</strong> [We learned about the masks] when we got there. It was ridiculous... I was kind of an anomaly on the show. My legal secretary had sent in the application. It&apos;s really not my style. Most of the guys that were on that were seeking to be in TV entertainment, and that kind of thing. And I would say that was almost everybody moved to L.A. after. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="39947635"><span>All I knew is that it was supposed to be based on personality. They gave us very little information. I had no idea Monica Lewinsky was going to be on there. That was circus-like. I had no clue, and had I known that, I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve done it. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="921822"><span>I have no regrets in doing it. But I think that that alone would have been enough for me to go <em>that&apos;s ridiculous. I&apos;m not fucking doing this</em>. But it was right after <em>Joe Millionaire</em> premiered [in January 2003]. I&apos;m a 28-year-old kid from modest means, just started out as a young lawyer, and single. And I&apos;m thinking, <em>fuck, what if I win a million bucks</em>? </span></blockquote><hr class="hr"><p><em>Mr. Personality</em> didn&#x2019;t have a cash prize. But despite the negative reviews, and the fact that it premiered during <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/05/watching-wanda">National TV-Turnoff Week</a>, the show proved an attractive spectacle, at least briefly. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lewinsky-dating-show-scores-second/">More than 12 million</a> people <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-04-22-personality_x.htm">tuned into</a> its premiere, though by the second episode, viewership had dropped 29 percent, as reported by the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>. By the season&#x2019;s end, interest waned enough that Fox cut down the finale from two hours to one, as reported in <em>USA Today</em>. (That the first episode of the three-night Season 2 finale of the wildly popular <em>American Idol</em> aired the same night (and drew 16.9 million viewers, according to the AP) was likely a factor.) Still, <a href="https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/fox-cbs-finales-top-monday-1117886551/">more than 11 million people</a> tuned in to watch Arp take the mask off of her new love, a real estate investor named William Dyck, and see his face for the first time. The moment lives on in the work of newspaper critics.</p><hr class="hr"><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="26266650"><span>In his final plea for Arp&apos;s affection, Dyck, 28, went for the heart. First, he told her he loved her. Then, in front of television viewers, Dyck dropped to one knee and proposed. An estimated audience of 11.5 million viewers watched Arp say yes. That&apos;s when the show&apos;s host, Monica Lewinsky, pointed out that Arp had just agreed to marry a man she had never seen. When Dyck finally was unmasked, Arp summed up her feelings in two words: &#x2018;Um, wow.&#x2019; </span><footer class="pullquote__attribution">&#x2014; <cite>Rick Bentley, The Fresno Bee, May 22, 2003e</cite></footer></blockquote><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="42573617"><span>&#x201C;Even a reality show as vilified as Fox&apos;s <em>Mr. Personality</em>, the show hosted by Monica Lewinsky in which a female supposedly picked her future husband from a series of masked men, benefits from FM buzz.

Fox&apos;s upcoming dating show <em>Mr. Personality</em> with a disgraced and disgraceful Monica Lewinsky hosting as a woman chooses among several masked men, sounds like an early April Fools&apos; joke.

With a reality TV show star as our president, it&#x2019;s no wonder that outrageous unscripted shows &#x2014; like <em>Dr. Pimple Popper</em>, <em><a href="../1923/live-pd-cops-ae-policing-reality-tv.html">Live PD</a>: Women on Patrol</em>, <em>Floribama Shore</em>, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/4970/the-proposal-show-review"><em>The Proposal</em></a>, <em>Seatbelt Psychic</em>, and the upcoming MTV <em>Jackass</em>-esque series <em>Too Stupid to Die</em> &#x2014; are once again bubbling up alongside the current spate of nostalgic revivals and reboots.
