But among all that equipment, Blood has a special four-armed turntable that makes him the perfect candidate to permanently archive the hundreds of thousands of random, discarded 78 rpm records amassed by The Internet Archive and New York&apos;s Archive of Contemporary Music. It&apos;s an ecclectic batch of audio from another time. Blood and his team of archivists are finding new historical artifacts every day, and making sure that they&apos;ll be playable well into the future.</p><iframe data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/OUT6490687169?light=true" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe><p>In a special episode of our podcast, <em><a href="../1359/the-outline-world-dispatch.html">The Outline World Dispatch</a></em>, Zo&#xEB; Beery reports from Philadelphia about how the Great 78 Project plans to preserve our aural history for generations to come.</p><div class="z9" data-id="9Sg6e5qR"></div><h2 class="h2">Subscribe</h2><p>There&apos;s a new episode of <em>The Outline World Dispatch</em> every Monday through Thursday.

He&#x2019;s been doing preservation and transfer work for almost three decades, and his small staff of engineers and librarians spend their days bringing remnants of the twentieth century into the twenty-first. Places like museums, libraries, and private companies and collectors send their obsolete media to George, and his studio turns it into digital files.

Where did he get so many records?</p><p><strong>Zo&#xEB; Beery:</strong> So, the original set of records that started this project off came from the Internet Archive itself. Since they&#x2019;re known for hosting so much old stuff, the guy who founded it, Brewster Kahle, has just slowly accumulated 78s over the years, from museums, libraries, collectors, anybody who has it and is like, &#x201C;Oh, they like old stuff. Maybe I&#x2019;ll give it to him!&#x201D; And because there was this problem with how long it takes to properly transfer a 78, he was just letting them sit in cold storage in San Francisco because it was going to be a nightmare to do it. Until he met George, who had this turntable that fixed the problem. And now he just ships a pallet of 78s to Philadelphia about once a month.</p><p>After a little over a year of doing transfers, the project has gotten a pretty good cross-section of the kinds of things that were recorded onto 78s. There&#x2019;s nearly every genre of music that existed at the time, from <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_al-compas-del-corazon_miguel-calo-y-su-orquesta-tipica-domingo-federico-homero-expo_gbia0020757a">some of the first Argentine tangos ever distributed</a>, to <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_kuu-home-native-plantation-song_s.-m.-kaiawe-hawaiian-quintette-montana_gbia0004340b">Hawaiian music played by Hawaiian performers</a> but marketed to white audiences.</p><p>And while the music is nice to listen to, much of it has been digitized before, and the archive only includes it for the sake of completeness.

It stars Abie Kabibble, the main character in a comic strip called Abie the Agent, which ran in newspapers across the US in the first few decades of the twentieth century. At the time, Abie was one of the only Jews in pop culture who was not an anti-Semitic caricature. And for Jews who wanted to assimilate into American society, he was proof that they could succeed.</p><p>The Abie disc is one of about three dozen entries so far in the Great 78 Project that are by or for Jews.

So <em>Basic Yiddish</em> isn&#x2019;t for language learners &#x2013; it&#x2019;s for a culture recovering from genocide, that wants to connect with a piece of their history that had become a symbol of both tragedy and resilience.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="121350123"><span><strong>George Blood:</strong> Why do we have to save these discs about teaching Yiddish?
