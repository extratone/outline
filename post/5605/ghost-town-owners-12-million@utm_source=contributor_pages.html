I&apos;m used to being by myself.&#x201D;</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Voight&apos;s view of Sunrise, taken from the only place in town where he has cell service" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180726-wcyJE0kAx0FVNIxFHKiw?q=100&amp;s=1c12014d1615dc631e9f1bfeb0194b7a" data-srcset></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Voight&apos;s view of Sunrise, taken from the only place in town where he has cell service <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of John Voight</span></p></div><div class="z9" data-id="ukN0Lx0w"></div><p>But Sunrise, population 1, gets plenty of visitors. Last August, nearly 1,000 tourists descended on the town to witness the solar eclipse; Sunrise was directly in its path. And recently, a newly discovered, 13,000-year-old archaeology site on the property &#x2014; one of the oldest Native American archaeology sites in the nation &#x2014; has brought in dozens of researchers to excavate the soil.</p><p>Voight&#x2019;s decision to buy Sunrise in 2011 tracks with his lifelong adventurous streak. When he was in his early twenties, he moved from Wyoming, where he grew up, to Saudi Arabia and Libya to farm wheat and alfalfa. He returned to Wyoming in his mid-twenties to try out real estate. He&#x2019;s also dabbled in performing music (&#x201C;did that for a number of years&#x201D;), owning a restaurant (&#x201C;I had a steakhouse and dancehall&#x201D;), and traveling (&#x201C;crazy stuff, it&#x2019;s been a lot of fun&#x201D;).</p><p>Voight first met the former owner of Sunrise, a mining town created by the Colorado Fuel and Iron company, in the early 1990s when he was deep in Cheyenne, Wyoming&#x2019;s commercial real-estate game. Nearly two decades later, when the owner decided to sell Sunrise, Voight jumped at the chance to buy it.</p><div class="z9" data-id="aijVnA6q"></div><p>&#x201C;I was looking for one more good adventure. I still had lots of physical strength and stamina,&#x201D; Voight, who is now 62, said. &#x201C;So I thought, &#x2018;well, let&#x2019;s try mining, I&#x2019;ve never done mining.&#x2019;&#x201D; He received an offer of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1414043/000119983513000687/exhibit_10-1.htm">$12 million</a> for the town, which is now little more than a few abandoned brick houses, a chemical lab, and a YMCA built by John D. Rockefeller at the turn of the 20th century.</p><hr class="hr"><p>&#x201C;Ghost town&#x201D; is an unofficial designation that refers to formerly recognized towns whose population has moved out often because of economic change. Many are located alongside mines or agricultural areas.</p><div class="z9" data-id="iEhayAgm"></div><p>When the population winnowed to zero, the towns became unincorporated, meaning they lost the traditional political infrastructure of a town (e.g. a mayor) and the census stopped including them in surveys. If you move to a ghost town, the postal service requires you to either keep a PO box in the nearest incorporated town or to place a mailbox along an interstate highway, according to Jake Rasmuson, a California-based real-estate agent who has two ghost town sales to his name. That&apos;s because a mailing address in an unincorporated town like Sunrise doesn&apos;t count.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Overview of California ghost town Cerro Gordo" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180726-dsjeMniXeQ2YLNUbTWRL?q=100&amp;s=0efbe8c396938a3e8b43bc3400da0490" data-srcset></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Overview of California ghost town Cerro Gordo <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of Jake Rasmuson</span></p></div><p>John Voight is one of hundreds of individuals, corporations, and churches across the U.S. who buy ghost towns to fulfill an investment dream, preserve a property&#x2019;s historic value, or abandon society to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/home-of-truth">launch a cult</a>.</p><div class="z9" data-id="cNeam42K"></div><p>There&#x2019;s Nipton, California, which Arizona-based marijuana company American Green bought for $5 million last year with the widely publicized but quickly <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/remember-that-cannabis-ghost-town-yeah-not-happening">abandoned</a> dream of turning it into a weed mecca. In 2012, Vietnamese coffee salesman Pham Dinh Nguyen <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/americas-tiniest-town-is-sold-and-renamed-phindeli-town-buford-wyoming">took control</a> of Buford, Wyoming for $900,000 and renamed it &#x201C;PhinDeli Town Buford,&#x201D; after his PhinDeli coffee brand &#x2014; apparently as an elaborate marketing tactic (he told <em>ABC News</em> that his ultimate hope was to remake the town <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/calif-ghost-town-sale-craigslist-towns-sale/story?id=20878063">into</a> a &#x201C;nerve center of a coffee importing operation that might some day reach every corner of the U.S.&#x201D;). The restaurant group ATX Brands bought the central-Texas town of Bankersmith in 2012, renaming it Bikinis, Texas to <a href="https://www.statesman.com/business/asking-price-slashed-for-ghost-town-once-known-bikinis-texas/kPzMiDTSGAdqMYeu4UqplM/">promote</a> its Hooters-esque &#x201C;breastaurant&#x201D; chain, Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill. As of January, however, the town was on the market for $975,000.</p><p>Churches are also taking advantage of the ghost-town market. Iglesia Ni Cristo, the Filipino denomination of the Church of Christ, bought the abandoned town of Johnsonville, Connecticut for $1.85 million last year with the intent of <a href="https://incmedia.org/abandoned-village-in-johnsonville-conn-to-breathe-new-life-after-purchase-by-the-iglesia-ni-cristo-church-of-christ/">renovating it</a> for its members. The church&#x2019;s other U.S. ghost town property &#x2014; Scenic, North Dakota, purchased for $800,000 in 2014 &#x2014; has already become home to a newly built congregation.

In 2006, for instance, one family bought six acres of the abandoned town of Monse, Washington, which has a school, seven homes, a post office, and a general store, simply because they <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/calif-ghost-town-sale-craigslist-towns-sale/story?id=20878063">wanted</a> &#x201C;peace and quiet and to get out of the rat race,&#x201D; <em>ABC News</em> reported.</p><p>Jake Rasmuson, the real-estate agent, told <em>The Outline</em> that &#x201C;there is not a demographic out there that does not want to buy a ghost town.&#x201D;</p><p>Rasmuson&#x2019;s most recent ghost town sale, Cerro Gordo, a former silver mining town on the edge of Death Valley National Park that depopulated following its peak in 1869, went for $1.4 million in mid-July after the listing drew headlines in <em>CNN</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>. The town&#x2019;s 22 buildings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/cerro-gordo-ghost-town-california.html">including</a> a saloon that still has a mysterious bloodstain on one of its walls, make it a rare artifact of the post-Gold Rush boomtown &#x2014; Rasmuson characterized purchasing it as &#x201C;buying a piece of history&#x201D; because the town&#x2019;s structures are much better preserved than those in most ghost towns.</p><div class="z9" data-id="MbT0u9h3"></div><p>The interest in Cerro Gordo was overwhelming. Rasmuson fielded hundreds of interested calls from every state in the U.S. and from Japan, India, and multiple countries in Europe.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Cerro Gordo saloon" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180726-2Fn4gr2FiVL3751J0Oco?q=100&amp;s=55d5c79c1718cb8b6b9063e1e62cbdb0" data-srcset></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Cerro Gordo saloon <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of Jake Rasmuson</span></p></div><p>Rasmuson said that his first ghost-town sale, an old smelting town around 10 miles from Cerro Gordo called Swansea, didn&#x2019;t &#x201C;have the panache&#x201D; of Cerro Gordo; it was small and run-down (though it was the focus of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUpElXWVMj4">Joanna Newsom song</a>). Still, when the sellers of Swansea first contacted Rasmuson about putting their town on the market, he was ecstatic.</p><p>&#x201C;If I could just specialize in ghost towns, I absolutely would,&#x201D; he said. Certainly, ghost towns &#x201C;require a bit more work&#x201D; to sell than a regular home, but he&#x2019;s already identified specific strategies for locking down a deal fast: target buyers who know the area and care about the history, and generate publicity in the media, which never seems to tire of the ghost-town-for-sale articles that are an invaluable source of promotion.</p><p>After a month, Cerro Gordo was purchased by Texas-based entrepreneur Brent Underwood and his business partner Jon Bier. Underwood told <em>The Outline</em> that his plan is to establish a bustling lodging business in the town. With a some added infrastructure &#x2014; a new water system, for example &#x2014; and some cleaning, Underwood thinks his town can become a destination for history buffs, writers&#x2019; retreats, and company getaways. Music festival and theater performance bookers have already reached out to him about having events in the town.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Brent Underwood, new ghost town owner" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180730-5LYJNaLfPw2QQylyKVRA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=cf0d25d05bb3368505e27e7ca40f7008" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180730-5LYJNaLfPw2QQylyKVRA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=5c40cf21b1aeb4d268e6d0483c525974 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180730-5LYJNaLfPw2QQylyKVRA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=29b198de44e513c7eeffec527d7ba0b6 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Brent Underwood, new ghost town owner <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of Brent Underwood</span></p></div><p>But Underwood said that his decision to buy Cerro Gordo was, above all, an emotional one. &#x201C;Right now it&#x2019;s certainly 80 percent dream, 20 percent financial,&#x201D; Underwood said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s probably better places to put your money right now than buying a ghost town. But at the end of the day, you have to think to yourself, what do I make money for? And for me personally, if I had an infinite amount of money, I would probably do something like buy a ghost town.&#x201D;</p><hr class="hr"><p>Within a single decade, Brandon Easley turned Albert, Texas &#x2014; an old farming town that he bought in 2009 &#x2014; into a major wedding destination. Last year, Easley said he was booking &#x201C;43 or 44&#x201D; weddings per year.</p><p>But marketing Albert to the soon-to-be-married was never part of the plan. Actually, there was hardly ever a plan. When Easley set foot in Albert for the first time after buying it, he remembered thinking: &#x201C;Oh shit, what did I do?&#x201D;</p><p>Easley, a real-estate salesman who typically deals in ranches, convinced his family to purchase the town right after the financial crisis. He was looking for a new investment, and he thought, <em>Why not a town?</em></p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Abandoned store in Cerro Gordo" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180726-tBhQEGV10SI868iue2Do?q=100&amp;s=42aeee7cfc4c340987489f48adba95b8" data-srcset></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Abandoned store in Cerro Gordo <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of Jake Rasmuson</span></p></div><p>Albert was about an hour away from his home in Austin, and he&#x2019;d stopped there a few times after work trips. He was charmed. In the early 1900s, Easley said, Albert was home to a popular storefront that made it the hub of the area &#x2014; the town regularly filled with wagons &#x2014; but now all that&#x2019;s left is a 100-year-old dancehall, an open-air bar (&#x201C;it has a pretty solid group of regulars&#x201D;), and a 12-acre pecan orchard.</p><p>Easley became hooked on the idea of owning the town in 2007, when an insurance broker named Bobby Cave put Albert up for sale on eBay. &#x201C;I think it was more of a dream than an idea at that point,&#x201D; Easley said. But when he told his parents about his vision &#x2014; &#x201C;I know this is crazy, but what do y&#x2019;all think?&#x201D; &#x2014; they were enthused. &#x201C;I was actually very surprised. My dad said, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s freaking cool.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>In late 2009, after the housing market collapsed and the price of Albert tumbled with it, Easley saw his chance. He emailed in a cash offer. &#x201C;Eight days later, we had a town,&#x201D; he said with a laugh. &#x201C;We didn&apos;t know what the hell we were doing.&#x201D;</p><p>Easley&#x2019;s initial aim was to turn Albert&#x2019;s dancehall into a concert venue &#x2014; he figured musical performances would draw visitors. But then one of his friends asked if him if they could have their kid&#x2019;s wedding in the dancehall, and Easley realized he could cater to an even better audience: new couples.</p><p>The fact that there&#x2019;s no lodging in Albert hasn&#x2019;t discouraged wedding planners. Easley told <em>The Outline</em>, &#x201C;What people like about it is, people can say, &#x2018;Hey, we rented a town.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s a hell of a lot better than, &#x2018;We rented the ballroom at the Marriott.&apos;&#x201D;</p><hr class="hr"><p>John Voight&#x2019;s plan to sustain Sunrise through iron mining didn&#x2019;t exactly pan out.</p><p>At first, everything was great. He was selling &#x201C;tremendous&#x201D; amounts of iron, and he started plotting ways to resurrect Sunrise and its historic YMCA. But then, in 2014, the iron markets collapsed because of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2748075-iron-ore-collapse-the-strategy-behind-low-prices">oversupply</a> in China, and Voight had to reinvent himself again.</p><p>&#x201C;I was a little apprehensive, but I don&#x2019;t let those kinds of things worry me,&#x201D; Voight said. &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s my philosophy: the more people that say I&#x2019;m crazy when I do something, the more likely it&#x2019;s going to work because I&#x2019;m going to have less competition. If no one else has tried it, you know, I&#x2019;m not going to have any competition for what I do.&#x201D;</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Visitors at the Sunrise YMCA" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180726-ln3kr0AUIYovcQkt9eDV?q=100&amp;s=9a4cb09cef2318f1ace1ec683c222a97" data-srcset></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Visitors at the Sunrise YMCA <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of John Voight</span></p></div><p>So, like his fellow ghost-town owners, he pivoted to tourism. But not the kind of tourism that goes on in Albert or Cerro Gordo &#x2014; Voight is not an entrepreneur looking to make Sunrise into a resort-like destination for imitation Bonnaroos and corporate retreats. He wanted to bring people to Sunrise to share the town&#x2019;s history and resources.</p><p>The way Voight tells it, scientists from across the U.S. are flocking to Sunrise to conduct research. In addition to the dozens of archaeologists who are currently digging through local artifacts like bone tools or arrowheads there, bat researchers have dropped by to conduct studies &#x2014; &#x201C;we have a lot of unique bats here,&#x201D; he said &#x2014; and geologists have visited as well &#x2014; &#x201C;geologists love to come here because it&apos;s twisting and turning, it&#x2019;s very unusual.&#x201D; (Sunrise is home to one of the <a href="http://www.wsgs.wyo.gov/public-info/guide-hartville-uplift">oldest known</a> quarries in North America.)</p><p>Voight paused as he rattled off his list of visitors. &#x201C;I have a lot of people that want to come up here and look for ghosts, too,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s weird.&#x201D;</p><p>Included in that list of ghost hunters &#x2014; Sam and Dean from <em>Supernatural</em>, which <a href="http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=6.18_Frontierland">filmed</a> a 2011 episode in Sunrise.</p><p>None of this is to say Voight is actually turning a profit on Sunrise. The recent influx of visitors hasn&#x2019;t brought any money into the town. But Voight isn&#x2019;t concerned about that &#x2014; he&apos;s earning a sizable income from his earlier real-estate investments. Plus, there&#x2019;s still a rare trickle of cash from his iron mine. As he noted to <em>The Outline</em>, &#x201C;I did have a rock sale last month.&#x201D;</p><iframe data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/OUT8594483226?" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe><p><em>Listen to an interview with Michael Waters for more thoughts about buying ghost towns on <a href="../1359/the-outline-world-dispatch@zd=1&amp;zi=4ptctpam.html">The Outline World Dispatch</a>.</em></p> </div> </article> <div class="post-micronative-footer"></div> <div class="post-footer"></div> </div> </div> </path-page> </div> </path-element> </path-plane> </path-root> </main> <div class="navigation"> <nav class="navigation__menu"> <a class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--logo" href="../../index.html" aria-label="Back to homepage"> <span class="icon icon-logo"></span> </a> <button class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--hamburger" type="button" aria-label="Open menu"> <span class="icon icon-menu"></span> </button> </nav> <div class="menu"> <button type="button" class="menu__close-button" aria-label="Close menu"> <span class="icon icon-close"></span> </button> <div class="menu__wrapper"> <h1 class="logo menu__logo" data-color="black"> <a class="logo__link menu__logo__link" href="../../index.html"> <span>The Outline</span> </a> </h1> <div class="menu__links"> <div class="menu__outmojis__wrapper"> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/recent.html"> Recent </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/power.html"> Power </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/culture.html"> Culture </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/future.html"> Future </a> <div class="menu__outmojis"> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="1"></div> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="2"></div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="menu__footer"> <div class="menu__social"> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-facebook"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.twitter.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-twitter"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.instagram.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-instagram"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/outline?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-youtube"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://flipboard.com/@TheOutline?utm_campaign=tools&amp;utm_medium=follow&amp;utm_source=theoutline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-flipboard"></span> </a> </div> <div class="menu__footer__links"> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> About </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://www.bustle.com/info/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Legal </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://jobs.lever.co/bustle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Jobs </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../tips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Got A Tip?
