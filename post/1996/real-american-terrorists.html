He was certain Islamberg, New York, a small community in the Catskills, was one of them &#x2014; and that its residents were involved in an impending terrorist plot to poison the nearby Delaware River, which supplies New York City with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/24/nyregion/how-nyc-gets-its-water-new-york-101.html">most of its drinking water</a>.</p><div class="z9" data-id="hCLCs0nH"></div><p>Islamberg was established in 1983 by a group of black Muslims led by a Pakistani Sufi cleric named Mubarak Ali Gilani, who urged his followers to leave behind the crime, poverty, and racism of New York City for a simple, rural life.</p><p>In 2002, the U.S. government investigated Gilani to determine whether he was involved in the kidnapping and beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, but the FBI <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0702/10/siu.02.html">said in 2007</a> that he &#x201C;was not involved&#x201D; in the incident. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/02/17/frightening-film-on-us-terrorism-training-camps.html">Fox News</a> and other right-wing media have alleged that Gilani was setting up U.S.-based fronts for Jamaat ul-Fuqra, a Pakistani organization that the U.S. State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/www/global/terrorism/1999report/patterns.pdf">deemed a terrorist group</a> in 1999. Islamberg&#x2019;s residents and leaders deny this claim. &#x201C;The Muslims of America and Sheikh Gilani, we have no affiliation with Fuqra. I don&#x2019;t know where they&#x2019;re getting all that,&#x201D; Muhammad Matthew Gardner, an Islamberg resident and spokesperson for the organization, told <em>The Outline</em>. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re not part of us and we&#x2019;re not part of them.&#x201D;</p><p>Islamberg is now the headquarters of The Muslims of America, Inc., an organization that oversees a dozen other rural Muslim communities like it. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;You need to get away from the city, get away from the decadence, get away from the sinning. Raise your families in the country, in rural areas in the mountains,&#x2019;&#x201D; Gardner said. Islamberg is only accessible by driving up a winding mountain road, and the only marker letting you know you&#x2019;ve made it to the town&#x2019;s entrance is a sign that reads &#x201C;Holy Islamberg.&#x201D; Approximately 250 people live in the sprawling community, which is built on 70 acres of land, Gardner said. The community has coexisted without incident with the neighboring towns of Deposit, Hancock, and Tompkins since its establishment in the early &#x2018;80s. After 9/11, however, local authorities found themselves constantly debunking rumors that Islamberg harbored terrorists and was training its residents in guerrilla warfare.</p><div class="z9" data-id="Ad0pl43V"></div><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="34709057"><span>&quot;We will be cruel to them, and we will burn down their buildings.

In 2009, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/02/17/frightening-film-on-us-terrorism-training-camps.html"><em>Hannity</em> aired</a> a clip that allegedly depicted MOA-affiliated communities training in guerrilla warfare and suggested they were associated with al Qaeda.</p><p>Local authorities have repeatedly denied the allegations made against Islamberg. In January 2015, the conservative website <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/01/local-police-speak-out-about-islamberg/">World Net Daily</a> &#x2014; which by that point had been running conspiracy-laded pieces on Islamberg for nine years &#x2014; spoke to local sheriffs from Delaware County, who denied the slew of allegations levied against Islamberg&#x2019;s residents by right-wing bloggers and pundits.</p><div class="z9" data-id="CzBdIlwQ"></div><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s kind of perplexing to us,&#x201D; Craig Dumont, deputy sheriff of Delaware County, told the website. &#x201C;All this recent media attention in regard to potential terrorist training camps and things that are going on here, we just don&#x2019;t see it. We don&#x2019;t see it. We don&#x2019;t find any of that to be valid at this time.&#x201D;</p><p>But Doggart was convinced the conspiracy theories were true. He began plotting an attack of his own around February 2015, using social media to call on fellow &#x201C;patriots&#x201D; to join him. &#x201C;Thank you for your inquiry. I will add you to the list of Patriots who might decide to do this thing,&#x201D; Doggart wrote to a possible co-conspirator in a private message. &#x201C;Make no mistake, though. Our lives will be on the line and there is no going back when we step over the line, no different than the original Patriots who established this great Nation.&#x201D;</p><p>His plan was to burn down Islamberg&#x2019;s mosque and school, and he was prepared to kill or be killed in the process. &#x201C;We will be cruel to them,&#x201D; Doggart said of Islamberg&#x2019;s residents in an intercepted phone call, &#x201C;and we will burn down their buildings.

Most had come from out of town: one couple drove in from New Jersey the night before; another pair woke up at 3 a.m. on the day of the rally to make the seven-hour-long drive down from Maine. Joseph Glasgow, who organized the event through a Facebook page he runs called &#x201C;Islamberg Friend or Foe?&#x201D;, had driven in from Georgia.</p><div class="z9" data-id="BkYFBLyn"></div><p>Glasgow, a landscaper from Athens, Georgia, appears to be a member of the Three Percenters, a &#x201C;patriot movement&#x201D; that claims to fight against unconstitutional overreach by the federal government.

In the months leading up to the rally, Glasgow regularly posted updates and announcements on his profile, typically reminding attendees they couldn&#x2019;t bring guns since New York is not an open-carry state and claiming Islamberg&#x2019;s residents would be armed.</p><p>&#x201C;These are not innocent Muslim people.

When it comes down to it, believe me, if a woman or child has to pick up a gun and shoot one of us, they&#x2019;re going to pick up a gun and shoot one of us.&#x201D; In that video, Glasgow acknowledged that local police told him they had a &#x201C;good working relationship&#x201D; with Islamberg&#x2019;s residents. &#x201C;We just want to draw attention to the fact that these &#x2018;Islamic villages,&#x2019; as they call them &#x2014; terror training camps, as we call them &#x2014; exist.&#x201D;</p><div class="photo-grid-embed" data-margin="false" data-type="1"><div class="photo-grid-embed__wrapper"><div class="photo-grid-embed__photos"><div class="photo-grid-embed__photos_wrapper"><div class="photo-grid-embed__item" data-text="true"><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Members of the Three Percenters, a &#x201C;patriot movement&#x201D; that claims to fight against unconstitutional overreach by the federal government." class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-nB9BLGm2Pa8oDGDJyZMx?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=89298d6cc741926fb884b788e97933ef" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-nB9BLGm2Pa8oDGDJyZMx?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=f868375b6154d5fc40e0612259dcb9bf 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-nB9BLGm2Pa8oDGDJyZMx?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=a40f8c7d8b2e7ce15a2f9a4a2db851c4 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Members of the Three Percenters, a &#x201C;patriot movement&#x201D; that claims to fight against unconstitutional overreach by the federal government. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">The Outline</span></p></div></div><div class="photo-grid-embed__item" data-text="true"><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Cheryl and James Murray and their dogs, Chaos and Mayhem, drove in from New Jersey." class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-tOHSHmcwj0RhHMMNtwX0?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=0af67936daabfc31c56423de4584215a" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-tOHSHmcwj0RhHMMNtwX0?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=f716cc6c599e9e61e6e53863fa2e56c5 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20170727-tOHSHmcwj0RhHMMNtwX0?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=e26162ac494538274909a366c4fe3289 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Cheryl and James Murray and their dogs, Chaos and Mayhem, drove in from New Jersey. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">The Outline</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="photo-grid-embed__captions"><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Members of the Three Percenters, a &#x201C;patriot movement&#x201D; that claims to fight against unconstitutional overreach by the federal government. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">The Outline</span></p><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Cheryl and James Murray and their dogs, Chaos and Mayhem, drove in from New Jersey. <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">The Outline</span></p></div></div><div class="z9" data-id="a7EaRP3z"></div><p>Glasgow&#x2019;s rally attracted members of several right-wing groups: the <a href="../1760/fred-perry-polo-skinheads.html">Proud Boys</a>, a fraternity of &#x201C;western chauvinists&#x201D; led by <em>VICE</em> cofounder Gavin McInnes, the anti-Muslim advocacy group ACT for America, and the Oathkeepers, another &#x201C;patriot movement&#x201D; similar to the Three Percenters.</p><p>Several protesters claimed that Islamberg and similar communities operate under sharia law &#x2014; which to them, means residents engage in &#x201C;female genital mutilation, throwing gays from buildings, honor killings, and stoning women to death.&#x201D; (Afaf Nasher, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told <em>The Outline</em> that sharia law is similar to Catholic or Jewish doctrine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a body of law that came out of religious principles that govern various personal affairs,&#x201D; like divorce, Nasher said, and American Muslims aren&#x2019;t &#x201C;going to ask [the government] to implement any laws that are against United States laws on the books.

But they do unpredictably erupt with car burnings, attacks on representatives of the state (including police), and riots.&#x201D;</p><p>Despite Pipes&#x2019; correction, far-right media, including <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/01/22/inside-frances-sharia-no-go-zones/">Breitbart</a> and <a href="https://www.infowars.com/reporters-chased-out-of-muslim-no-go-zone/">InfoWars</a>, have claimed that police in Sweden, France, and Germany are too frightened to even enter Muslim-majority neighborhoods. After the French satirical newspaper <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> was attacked in January 2015, Fox News latched on to the no-go zone myth &#x2014; and later was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/world/europe/fox-news-apologizes-for-false-claims-of-muslim-only-areas-in-england-and-france.html">forced to issue an apology</a> for making false claims on air, a rarity for the network. But the conspiracy persisted. When asked where they had heard about no-go zones and sharia law, most protesters cited the Clarion Project (previously called the Clarion Fund), a right-wing nonprofit whose stated mission is to &#x201C;[educate] the public about the dangers of radical Islam.&#x201D; (The Southern Poverty Law Center considers the Clarion Project and ACT for America <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/anti-muslim">anti-Muslim hate groups</a>).</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="42170971"><span>&quot;People like to use &#x2018;sharia&#x2019; and words that sound foreign to promote this idea that Islam is not compatible with the U.S. Constitution and with American principles, which is nonsense.&quot;</span><footer class="pullquote__attribution">&#x2014; <cite>Afaf Nasher, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations</cite></footer></blockquote><p>The Clarion Project, whose list of donors includes billionaire casino owner and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, is largely responsible for bringing these conspiracy theories into the mainstream.

In a phone call with <em>The Outline,</em> MOA spokesperson Muhammad Matthew Gardner said the video was not filmed in Islamberg. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know anything about those videos,&#x201D; Gardner said. &#x201C;When he&#x2019;s quoting his &#x2018;source,&#x2019; that information is garbage.

After local police nabbed Abdullah for shoplifting, they discovered a cache of weapons, including four handguns, eight assault weapons, and two rifles, on Abdullah&#x2019;s property.
