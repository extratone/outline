internet says it will help you lose weight, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/28/ketogenic-diets-silicon-valley-investors-body-hack-for-better-health.html">live longer</a>, and improve <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a19533636/ketogenic-diet-live-longer-memory-obesity/">your memory</a>. Sounds great, you say? Except that these benefits will only bloom once you cut carbohydrates. Familiar story, right? The Atkins diet is back? We&#x2019;re all gonna start eating eggs and bacon for every meal again until our cholesterol inevitably reaches code-red levels?</p><p>No, this new obsession is not Atkins. It&#x2019;s the ketogenic diet, lovingly called &#x201C;keto,&#x201D; popularized by <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a22000172/halle-berry-keto-diet/">actors</a>, <a href="https://newdimensionsfitness.co.uk/10-ketogenic-diet-instagrammers-need-follow/">Instagram</a> stars, and the same people who brought you <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/4/16846048/raw-water-trend-silicon-valley">raw water</a>.</p><p>If you believe a diet is supposed to be a varied landscape of all the things the world has to offer in moderation, keto may not be the diet for you. Let&#x2019;s find out if science says it&#x2019;s worth it.</p><div class="z9" data-id="QuqQFqko"></div><h2 class="h2">What is the ketogenic diet?</h2><p>The history of keto goes much farther than an attempt to stem weight gain during our fat-fearing era. In 1921, it was <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/07/06/99034172.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=25">observed</a> that fasting decreased incidence of seizure in epileptic patients. The same year, reports noted cognitive improvement and reduced seizure activity in epileptics who fasted for two to three days (fasting has been used as far back as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01821.x">500 B.C.</a> to treat epilepsy).</p><p>Around the same time, it was discovered that the metabolic change caused by fasting that controlled seizures also occurred when a patient stopped eating carbohydrates. It was then that an endocrinologist named Dr. Rollin Woodyatt had a scientific breakthrough: he found that the compounds <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058661/">acetone and beta-hydroxybutyric</a> acid were detectable in high levels in fasting patients (to be fair, they can <a href="https://patient.info/health/urine-ketones">also be present</a> in urine in low levels normally, and things like <a href="https://patient.info/doctor/urine-ketones-meanings-and-false-positives-pro">dehydration</a> can trigger a false positive test). These compounds are classified as <a href="https://labtestsonline.org/tests/blood-ketones">ketones</a>, produced via the metabolic state of <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180858.php">ketosis</a>, which occurs when an elevated level of ketones are produced as a result of the body using fat for fuel as stored carbohydrate is depleted.</p><div class="z9" data-id="0A6m0K9L"></div><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="14569570"><span>The ketogenic diet keeps coming back into the larger consciousness, to the consternation of medical professionals.</span></blockquote><p>Doctors at the Mayo Clinic created a formula that manipulated the ketogenic effect that came with complete fasting by instead limiting a patient&#x2019;s intake of carbohydrates. This was the genesis of the <a href="https://keystoketosis.com/the-birth-of-the-ketogenic-diet/">ketogenic diet</a>. To manage childhood epilepsy, the prescribed diet consisted of one gram of protein per kilogram of body mass &#x2014; a max of 15 grams of carbs &#x2014; and the rest of the calories from fat. Et voila: the ketogenic diet was born.</p><p>A strict version of the diet is still used to <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet">manage</a> drug-resistant epilepsy. But it&#x2019;s fallen out of favor because the success rate of a large suite of readily available anti-epileptic medications. It&#x2019;s been observed that children on this diet for epilepsy <a href="https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/ketogenic-diet#.W4m7My3MwWo">don&#x2019;t generally become overweight</a> and tend to <a href="https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036890528&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=257bed79b6652f34c3af25de6ef0cbaf">lose some weight</a> in the first few months on the diet, but it&#x2019;s not without its drawbacks. Children on keto tend to have <a href="https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/the-ketogenic-diet#2">higher cholesterol</a> than other children in their age range and there can be some nasty side effects, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/the-ketogenic-diet#2">including kidney stones</a>. Due to the public&#x2019;s appetite for miracle weight-loss cures, however, the diet keeps coming back into the larger consciousness, to the consternation of medical professionals.</p><div class="z9" data-id="vOA0vCVu"></div><h2 class="h2">how keto was reborn as Atkins was reborn as keto</h2><p>In 1997, a book titled <a href="https://www.atkins.com/our-story/atkins-diet-history"><em>Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution</em></a> climbed up the bestseller list for five years after it was first published (this edition of <em>Diet Revolution</em> was little more than a cosmetic overhaul of Dr. Robert Atkins&#x2019;s 1972 book, <em>Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution,</em> which didn&#x2019;t quite revolutionize diets in the way publishers hoped).</p><p>But this time around, America was primed for Atkins&#x2019;s theory that it wasn&#x2019;t fat but <em>carbohydrates</em> that caused weight gain. Food manufacturers and consumers had cut fat from their diets but obesity rates continued to rise; something was due to be the new culprit for our weight woes. Dr. Atkins was further vindicated by 2002 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html">article</a> by the science journalist Gary Taubes in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>. &#x201C;If the members of the American medical establishment were to have a collective find-yourself-standing-naked-in-Times-Square-type nightmare, this might be it,&#x201D; Taubes wrote. &#x201C;They spend 30 years ridiculing Robert Atkins, author of the phenomenally-best-selling <em>Dr. Atkins&#x2019; Diet Revolution</em> and <em>Dr. Atkins&#x2019; New Diet Revolution,</em> accusing the Manhattan doctor of quackery and fraud, only to discover that the unrepentant Atkins was right all along.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="w2e3nPbW"></div><p>At one point in the early 2000s, approximately <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4671251/ns/health-fitness/t/americans-low-carb-attempts-fall-short/#.W2Nt3C3MwWo">10 percent</a> of the country was on a low-carb diet. That&#x2019;s insane. What&#x2019;s more, people actively started avoiding carbs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/19/us/low-carb-boom-isn-t-just-for-dieters-anymore.html">even if they weren&#x2019;t on a diet.</a> &#x201C;A year ago, if you asked consumers what they watch, 11 percent would have said carbs,&apos;&apos; Michael Polk, the chief operating officer at Unilever-Best Foods, told <em>The Times.</em> &#x201C;Today if you ask, 40 percent of consumers say they are watching carbs. In our opinion, this has evolved into a major shift in consumer behavior.&#x201D; Atkins was able to build an industry out of his diet advice: <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/n_10035/index2.html">Atkins Nutritionals</a>, which cranked out low-carb meals and snacks, was at one point valued at approximately half a billion dollars.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--full" data-hash="113584069"><span>At one point in the early 2000s, <em>approximately 10 percent of the country</em> was on a low-carb diet.</span></blockquote><p>So why did Atkins fall out of favor? Well, the diet&#x2019;s delightful side effects could include fatigue, <a href="https://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/atkins_diet/atkins.htm">constipation</a>, excessive thirst, bad breath, the dreaded <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meat-sweats#1">meat sweats</a>, and worst, the look your friends would give you when you said you were on Atkins. There was also the fact that the diet wasn&#x2019;t really sustainable (kinda like most diets, funnily enough). In 2003, a pair of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/health/personal-health-pounds-lost-on-atkins-diet-may-quickly-return.html">studies</a> in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> found that most of the weight one initially lost while following Atkins was water weight; and subjects who followed the diet typically gained back any lost weight in six months.</p><div class="z9" data-id="i323UTw0"></div><p>Atkins Nutritionals filed chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005, a year after the doctor died after falling on an icy New York City sidewalk. Still, Atkins had a long-lasting impact on the dietary landscape in America. &#x201C;Sugar free&#x201D; and &#x201C;low carb&#x201D; labels never left the snack aisle. People still fell back on the idea that to lose weight, one simply had to cut carbs. But all the while, obesity rates climbed from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db288.pdf">30 percent up to 39 percent</a> of the country, priming the stage for another diet &#x201C;revolution.&#x201D;</p><h2 class="h2">the Rise of The Keto Gurus</h2><p>Losing weight has become a challenge to be solved through innovation, and the new diet gurus don&#x2019;t take kindly to the scientific method. It&#x2019;s in line with Dr. Atkins&#x2019;s legacy; he was a huge proponent of alternative and unproven medical treatments beyond just his ideas about nutrition. You almost can&#x2019;t blame him or the other diet gurus for leaning in on the techno-bullshit market; it&#x2019;s hard to fill up a 300 page diet book on &#x201C;eat a bit less and find a type of exercise that doesn&#x2019;t make you hate life.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="Z7MMFRHx"></div><p>Dave Asprey is one such tech guy-turned-low-carb guru.

Over the past two decades, Asprey says he&#x2019;s spent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bulletproof-dave-asprey-biohacking-spending-2017-4">$1 million</a> to &#x201C;biohack&#x201D; his body, turning it into a fat-burning machine and even increasing his IQ by 20 points. (Asprey has also said that he <a href="http://www.bodyforwife.com/the-buttered-coffee-guy-has-gone-off-the-fucking-deep-end/">blocks waves</a> out of his cells with glasses and takes supplements to help with the &#x201C;low oxygen high EMF [electromagnetic field] environment&#x201D; on airplanes, so.)</p><p>I&#x2019;ll give Asprey this: people have told me that the buttered coffee tastes okay and makes them feel energetic.

On keto, their bodies have turned into fat-burning machines that give the finger to the laws of thermodynamics, or something.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s hold up a sec. Allow me to introduce you to the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673150">DIETFITS Randomized Clinical Trial</a>, published in February 2018 in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association.</em> DIETFITS, which stands for Dietary Intervention Examining the Factors Interacting with Treatment Success, succeeded in busting a slew of dietary theories. Microbiome is responsible for everything? Nope. Predisposition to success on one diet based on genetics? Nah. Low carb over low fat? Uh-uh.</p><p>Over the course of a year, 609 participants were randomly sorted into low-fat or low-carb diet groups. They were given instruction on healthy habits and choices, along with practical advice on how to stick to the diets to which they had been assigned. Additionally, and possibly most importantly, they were instructed to keep their caloric intake limited similarly in both groups.</p><p>It&#x2019;s fairly common that, initially, low-carb dieters see more weight loss. This is because <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/2/21/16965122/keto-diet-reset">glycogen molecules bind with water</a>, and once you&#x2019;ve burned through your most <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O_7XIjDhAMYC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=carbohydrates+are+the+most+readily+available+source+of+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eFpUt2j901&amp;sig=0HcyA03_NYOlpcM7wdFdgU3WwXM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE37Ow79HbAhWhOn0KHRACA7I4ChDoAQhLMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=carbohydrates%20are%20the%20most%20readily%20available%20source%20of%20energy&amp;f=false">readily available source of energy</a>, you&#x2019;re also down a few pounds of water weight. Over time, that weight loss of the low-carb group evened out with the low-fat one; there was ultimately just a 1.5 lbs difference in weight loss between the two groups &#x2014; the low-fat group lost an average of 11.7 lbs the low-carb group 13.2 lbs. This is a difference reflective of which group took a shit before or after going for their final weigh-ins.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="27428768"><span>It&#x2019;s fairly common that, initially, low-carb dieters see more weight loss. But it doesn&#x2019;t last.</span></blockquote><p>A few variables were tested in conjunction with weight loss. One was initial insulin secretion, specifically to see if it had any affect on loss in each diet group. It did not. They had also checked a few genetic markers that were suspected to give dieters pre-dispositions to success either on low fat diets or low carb diets based on previous studies. However, genetics were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diet-fats-carbs/genes-might-not-predict-success-of-low-fat-or-low-carb-diet-idUSKCN1G42JN">shown to have no effect</a>.</p><p>But the most important takeaway from the study is that similar numbers of participants lost and gained similar amounts of weight <em>in both groups</em>. As Examine.com shows in its <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/low-fat-vs-low-carb-for-weight-loss/#ref1">analysis</a> of the study, charts comparing weight loss (or gain) from each group are almost identical.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="107746959"><span>In the beginning of the study, all participants were instructed to consume either &#x2264;20 g of fat (if in the low-fat group) or &#x2264;20 g of carbs (if in the low-carb group) for the first two months, after which they could increase either their fat or carb intake to levels they felt they could sustain <em>indefinitely</em>. By the end of the trial, the vast majority had not been able to maintain such low levels. The final dietary recalls reported an average daily fat intake of &#x2248;57 g (low-fat group) and an average daily carb intake of &#x2248;132 g (low-carb group).</span></blockquote><p>Part of what makes a diet work in the long run, of course, is a person&#x2019;s ability to stick with it, and most diets that cut out an entire food group or macronutrient are not sustainable.</p><p>Curiously, this study was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2679254">funded</a> by the Nutrition Science Initiative (NuSI), a group with the aim of producing &#x201C;conclusive results in the next decade&#x201D; in a sometimes confusing nutritional landscape.

This was the second published study that received funding from the institute. In the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/104/2/324/4564649">first study</a>, published in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> in 2016, researchers hypothesized that a low-carbohydrate diet increased energy expenditure. Results said otherwise:</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="71462961"><span>The carbohydrate&#x2013;insulin model predicts that the KD would lead to increased EE, thereby resulting in a metabolic advantage amounting to ~300&#x2013;600 kcal/d. Our data do not support EE increases of that magnitude. (...) In summary, we found that a carefully controlled isocaloric KD coincided with small increases in EE that waned over time. Despite rapid, substantial, and persistent reductions in daily insulin secretion and RQ after introducing the KD, we observed a slowing of body fat loss.</span></blockquote><p>In layman&#x2019;s terms: people burned marginally more calories at first, but there wasn&#x2019;t evidence that the diet increased caloric burn in the long term.</p><p>I suppose it&#x2019;s not a surprise that, per an investigation from <em>Wired</em>, NuSI seems to be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-dollar40-million-nutrition-science-crusade-fell-apart/">having trouble</a> scrounging up financial backing lately.</p><h2 class="h2">Keto and Low-Carb now have the same problem as Low-Fat</h2><p>Remember those insanely awful Snackwell&#x2019;s cookies and the chips that gave you anal leakage?

Unfortunately, a 2006 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/83/5/1055/4649481">study</a> in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> said that calorie per calorie, you&#x2019;ll lose the same amount of weight on both a ketogenic diet and a reduced calorie, controlled carb (but not ketogenic) diet.

This is because &#x2014; as study after study has shown &#x2014; calories and dietary adherence matter more than anything for weight loss. You can gain or lose weight on any combination of foods. People have lost weight on twinkies, McDonalds, juice, plants, and <a href="https://www.ketovangelist.com/one-year-83-pounds-and-now-i-am-a-total-bad-ass/">obscene amounts of meat</a>.</p><p>It&#x2019;s important to remember weight loss alone doesn&#x2019;t necessarily cause all health markers to improve, and a diet causing weight loss does not mean it&#x2019;s appropriate and healthy for everyone. Some foods are better than others at making weight loss and maintenance easier for different people, so balancing a diet is a fairly personalized thing. If your doctor gives you the green light and keto works for you, do it. If low fat works for you, do it. If plant-based, paleo, Mediterranean, or one of the zillion other diets help you improve your health and your relationship with food? Do it. There&#x2019;s no one right way to eat for everyone, just as there is no miracle diet plan for weight loss.</p><p>And please, talk to your doctor and a registered dietitian when considering a new diet plan.
