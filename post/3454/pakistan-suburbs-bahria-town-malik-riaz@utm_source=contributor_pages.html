I sit up and take notice whenever I&#x2019;m driving on it because there&#x2019;s an abrupt lack of potholes, and after jostling around the back of a rickshaw or taxi for most of my day, the unbroken surface is almost alarming. Unlike the rest of the city, the street lamps at this intersection glow bright at night, the asphalt always looks fresh, and there&#x2019;s no trash on the ground. The walls of the underpass are inscribed with a circular logo that spells out &#x201C;Bahria Town&#x201D; in Urdu script. &#x201C;This road brought to you by Bahria Town,&#x201D; reads a sign as you leave it.</p><p>Bahria Town claims to be Asia&#x2019;s largest private real estate company. It builds manicured planned communities outside of Pakistan&#x2019;s three major cities, Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi, as well as some key properties in urban areas. Fundamentally, Bahria Town sells private solutions to the ills of a state-run Pakistani urban habitat, one in which rolling blackouts and flooded streets are common occurrences. The company&#x2019;s images of life in one of its many planned communities &#x2014; gated towns that appear to be a perfect blend of bland American suburbs a la Phoenix or Houston and the dumb opulence of Dubai &#x2014; present an idyllic escape from the smog-filled urban decay of Karachi. &#x201C;Amidst Soft Grass and Pure Class,&#x201D; reads the company&#x2019;s website, &#x201C;Bahria Town is the force turning the vision of modern Pakistan into a reality.&#x201D;</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy to believe Bahria Town really is the force of modernity in a country rife with structural problems. Karachiites remark what a pleasure it is to drive through an intersection devoid of the usual urban mess. There&#x2019;s no stopping or stalling because of broken or ignored traffic lights, so there&#x2019;s none of the usual window tapping from beggars and hawkers. The intersection doesn&#x2019;t even require the presence of uniformed traffic cop, the stalwart token of post-colonial megacities. For the few minutes it takes to drive the half-mile road, it&#x2019;s easy to forget that you&#x2019;re in Pakistan at all. And when the Pakistan around you is one of disrepair and conspicuous poverty, it&#x2019;s not necessarily a bad feeling.</p><div class="z9" data-id="YsQNQv1l"></div><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-pXZAeJH0KMJDjoMlGHpQ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=40fcc59cb3772098463f86f639f816cf" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-pXZAeJH0KMJDjoMlGHpQ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=3ca3a5269a253d3d735612b2db39ae1a 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-pXZAeJH0KMJDjoMlGHpQ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=facee82e352b3fd75390e090479926d6 2000w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-pXZAeJH0KMJDjoMlGHpQ?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=3000&amp;s=e6a4715c6c729981dbca6e88c1e48bd9 3000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"><span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Meher Ahmad/The Outline</span></p></div><p>But the Bahria Town logos that run up and down the street remind you that it is not nice because of the Pakistani state. It&#x2019;s nice because of Malik Riaz, the man who created it. He and his real estate company are the face of a changing Pakistan, one with a growing middle class eager for their middle class trappings, and more specifically, their desire for suburban living.</p><hr class="hr"><div class="z9" data-id="t3HO9d0E"></div><p>Karachi is not a city known for its urban planning. The Pakistani port of more than 12 million &#x2014; 20 million if you count the vast sprawl that goes beyond the city&#x2019;s official borders &#x2014; is teeming with people that reside in tightly knit slums, save for the occasional wealthy neighborhoods where high walls and barbed wire give the urban elite an illusion of order. On the rare occasions it rains, half the city floods and raw waste and trash that normally rot in piles on the street become intermingled in a lovely stew that some 3 million cars wade through every day.

In a country where class and family define just about everything, his rags-to-riches story rings as more American than Pakistani. His father&#x2019;s business, once a successful contracting firm, collapsed when Riaz was a teenager. It&#x2019;s unclear exactly how it fell apart, despite many being familiar with his father&#x2019;s initial fortunes. He was forced to work as a clerk for a civilian wing of the army, a lowly position in the post-colonial bureaucratic hierarchy. It was there, according to local lore, that he learned the ins and outs of conducting real estate and construction in Pakistan, a lucrative but often unscrupulous business.</p><p>Riaz was awarded a contract in the mid-&#x2019;90s by a faction of the Pakistani Navy, called <em>Pakistan Bahria</em> in Urdu, to build housing in Islamabad and Lahore. Although originally hired as a contractor, Riaz took over the housing schemes entirely, eventually taking the Navy&#x2019;s name and creating Bahria Town, his own private real estate company. Despite <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1252809">serious allegations</a> of corruption and controversy &#x2014; illegally evicting residents of the land where he builds his towns, <a href="https://www.siasat.pk/forum/showthread.php?581265-Zardari-and-PPP-government-helping-Malik-Riaz-encroach-and-steal-lands-of-impoverished-underprivileged-for-Bahria-Town-Karachi-through-intimidation-and-police">teaming up</a> with powerful political elite for clout and protection &#x2014; Riaz reached his celebrity mogul status by successfully remaining one step ahead of an increasing number of Pakistanis wanting to leave the country&#x2019;s cities for a suburban life.</p><p>The company&#x2019;s inner workings are shrouded in mystery. Several <a href="https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/3308/criminal-negligence-needles-death-at-bahria-town-race-track/">deaths</a> that reportedly took place at Bahria Towns were barely covered by the local media. Last May, a local TV station was filming at Bahria Town&#x2019;s Islamabad neighborhood when the stage they were filming on collapsed, trapping dozens of people underneath and killing several, according to the handful of bloggers and Twitter users that <a href="https://www.mangobaaz.com/horrific-tv-show-incident-that-no-ones-talking-about/">posted about it</a>. Bahria Town&#x2019;s team was said to have immediately shut the lights off, packed up, and left, all while people struggled under the collapsed stage. Major TV news channels, usually intent on tragedy of the scandalous kind, suspiciously didn&#x2019;t give it any coverage. This could be because of Riaz&#x2019;s alleged media manipulation: he was <a href="http://aaj.tv/2012/06/a-list-of-19-journalists-allegedly-bribed-by-malik-riaz/">accused</a> in 2012 of bribing journalists for positive coverage of Bahria Town; also that year he was caught on video <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/393636/video-leak-lucman-bukhari-run-planted-show-with-malik-riaz/">negotiating</a> for a pre-planned live interview with two Pakistani TV anchors.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="57553812"><span>A little more than half of Karachi&#x2019;s Bahria Town plots have already been sold, even though the community isn&#x2019;t halfway built.</span></blockquote><p>In my repeated attempts to get even one representative from the company on the phone, I got trapped in an endless loop of operators and hold lines.

I mention this not to complain &#x2014; being sent on a run-around is par for the course reporting almost anywhere &#x2014; but to convey that Asia&#x2019;s biggest private real-estate company had zero interest in speaking with a reporter even to give a standard quote about commitment to &#x201C;turning the vision of modern Pakistan into a reality,&#x201D; or whatever.</p><p>Whether Riaz paid for them or not, Bahria has seen a lot of positive headlines on major Pakistani news sites in the last few months: <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1597537/1-bahria-town-hosts-grand-celebrations-three-cities/">&#x201C;Bahria Town hosts grand celebrations in three cities,&#x201D;</a>&#xA0; <a href="https://pakobserver.net/bahria-town-achieves-another-milestone-serve-masses-malik-riaz/">&#x201C;Bahria Town achieves another milestone to serve masses,&#x201D;</a>&#xA0; <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/258619-bahria-town-opens-modern-organ-transplant-centre">&#x201C;Bahria Town opens modern organ transplant center.&#x201D;</a> And the positive coverage of his planned communities seems to be working. The average Pakistani&#x2019;s view of Bahria Town also appears to be wholly positive. Riaz is <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/55792--45-billion-development-projects--malik-riaz-signs-contract-with-abu-dhabi-group">often</a>&#xA0; <a href="https://nation.com.pk/01-Dec-2017/bahria-town-karachi-to-build-its-own-dedicated-interchange-on-m-9-motorway">cited</a> as the only person bringing an international level of infrastructure to a country otherwise lagging in that category, and despite the dire messages I&#x2019;ve received on WhatsApp, third-party real estate agents have said sales and interest in the development has been consistently high.

I felt as if I was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BceHGzsDVLY">the ghost-pepper episode</a> of <em>The Simpsons</em>: I&#x2019;d look to my left and see a seemingly endless row of identical houses emerging from the desert, then to my right see a giant flower drooping over a tea cup. Every major roundabout in Bahria Town was adorned with either golden galloping horses or an unexplained surrealist interpretation of seemingly random objects: a golf ball, lions, flowers, and at times, plaques of Malik Riaz&#x2019;s face. The roads, often six lanes wide and perfectly painted, stretched deep into the desert, splitting off into subdivisions of half-built homes that could have been plucked from any suburb in the U.S. Eerily, the entire city was virtually empty save for construction workers squinting into the sun.</p><p>I pulled into one of the subdivisions and saw a group of workers, the biggest I&#x2019;d seen in one place since arriving in the community. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re caulkers,&#x201D; they said. Their only job was to caulk between the tiles in every house; they did the same job down the line of houses. &#x201C;We have about four more today,&#x201D; one of them told me. I looked down the row and counted at least 20 houses on the street, half of them still in need of a paint job. I walked into one of the half-built homes and immediately felt the familiarity of the suburban layout I grew up with in the middle of Indiana. One bathroom here, a kitchen there, the door to the backyard here. Though we were only an hour outside of Karachi, where the average family can barely afford a single-room house, I was standing in the middle of some twisted version of the American suburb.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="full"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-55xMMKMA0DA9Vlr02a3r?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=8e078587ed60646463363339fd5d292d" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-55xMMKMA0DA9Vlr02a3r?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=257362ba624515b6f4c1c8dcf117ae38 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-55xMMKMA0DA9Vlr02a3r?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=1191852ce5603ef36551547a1b032257 2000w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180218-55xMMKMA0DA9Vlr02a3r?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=3000&amp;s=1511ac7d8ef1064351ff5067fca501bc 3000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"><span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Meher Ahmad/The Outline</span></p></div><p>Each subdivision had a mini-mosque, space for parks and small public squares, signs for schools and hospitals. But perhaps the most unbelievable structure in the city is its massive mosque, called the Grand Jamia Mosque. It is staggering in size &#x2014; Bahria&#x2019;s site claims when completed, it will be the third-largest in the world, after the two holiest mosques in Saudi Arabia. &#x201C;With respect to their sanctity, no masjid can be holier than these Holi Masajid,&#x201D; reads the <a href="http://bahriatown.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=458&amp;Itemid=108">site</a>, as if to say, &#x201C;We could&#x2019;ve made it bigger but we are God-fearing people. But we could&#x2019;ve made it bigger.&#x201D;</p><p>By the time I&#x2019;d driven the length of Bahria Town Karachi, it was nearing dusk. The community is mostly under construction, which explained the lack of actual residents, but the combination Pizza Hut and Burger King near a large replica of the Parthenon seemed to be buzzing with activity. I popped in for a fountain soda, loudly announcing, &#x201C;This place is really something else!&#x201D; in Urdu to no one in particular, hoping to catch the attention of a family ordering next to me. It worked. They didn&#x2019;t live in Bahria Town &#x2014; &#x201C;Far too expensive for us,&#x201D; said the father, a middle-aged civil servant &#x2014; but lived nearby, in one of the last neighborhoods of Karachi proper. He explained his family liked coming to Bahria Town in the evenings to eat and walk around the Parthenon, especially because the green lawn surrounding the replica. &#x201C;The park near our home is dirty and broken. Here, the kids can play in a big open space,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Outside, in the lawn by the Parthenon replica, families and groups of young men were taking selfies, posing next to the fountains and perfectly manicured landscaping. Their joy was palpable. One acclimates to daily stresses of living in a megacity until an alternative reminds one that there is, in fact, a version of a life devoid of them. Though the majority there didn&#x2019;t seem to be residents of the community, their excitement at seemingly banal aspects of living hinted at some sort of aspiration forming. This is Pakistan&#x2019;s answer to the home with a white-picket fence, without the mid-20th century American middle-class emphasis on transparency, a free press, and anti-graft.</p><p>The trade-off, given Bahria Town&#x2019;s track record in its already short existence, is losing certain freedoms in exchange for stable and safe living. Living in Karachi, for all its decaying infrastructure and filth, affords some autonomy in the chaos, a chaos Bahria Town explicitly shuns. The question becomes: is it worth it? For the majority of the developing world, it seems the answer is a resounding &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;</p> <div class="post__credits"> <a href="https://twitter.com/_meher?lang=en">Meher Ahmad</a> is a freelance journalist in Karachi.
