aria-label="Share via email"><span class="icon-mail"></span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="post__body"> <p><em>The Outline</em> has uncovered a number of previously unpublished harassment complaints filed against <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/3796/cambridge-analyticas-leak-shouldnt-surprise-you-but-it-should-scare-you?zd=1&amp;zi=kkaeomgw">Cambridge Analytica and SCL</a> in response to the numerous political survey and messaging calls made on behalf of U.S. campaigns between 2013 and 2017. A significant portion of the complaints filed reference calls received in early-to-mid 2014, the same time period during which Cambridge Analytica provided &#x201C;campaign strategy and messaging advice&#x201D; to Republican campaigns in Colorado, Oregon, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Arkansas, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-cambridge-analytica-workers-say-firm-sent-foreigners-to-advise-us-campaigns/2018/03/25/6a0d7d90-2fa2-11e8-911f-ca7f68bff0fc_story.html">according to documents obtained by the <em>Washington Post</em></a>.</p><p>The complaints describe the companies&#x2019; data-gathering methods in great detail, which reportedly ranged from loaded political (and personal) surveys, paid focus groups, and sentiment analysis questionnaires. While there were a considerable number of complaints filed with the FCC over SCL&#x2019;s predatory conduct, most U.S. citizens voiced their concerns online on popular self-reporting sites, such as 800Notes.</p><p>Most took issue with the frequency and timing of Cambridge Analytica&#x2019;s calls &#x2014; which came at all hours, multiple times a day &#x2014; and the invasive, often personal, questions the company posed. The firm&#x2019;s constant harassment and shady tactics left most users suspicious of Cambridge Analytica&#x2019;s intentions. &#x201C;What is their political agenda? Who is their client?&#x201D; one Oregon resident asked after receiving multiple calls inviting them to join a focus group on &#x201C;race, nsa, abortion, gays.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="JUTTDSfe"></div><p>Though the use of a third party political consulting firm to conduct polls and surveys is in no way revolutionary, Cambridge Analytica isn&#x2019;t just any consulting firm. Infamous for <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/3796/cambridge-analyticas-leak-shouldnt-surprise-you-but-it-should-scare-you?zd=1&amp;zi=kkaeomgw">siphoning millions of users&#x2019; Facebook data</a> and (allegedly) <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/3948/welcome-to-the-age-of-the-data-mercenary">influencing voters around the world</a>, Cambridge Analytica (and its parent company SCL) has been <a href="../3832/david-carroll-was-fighting-cambridge-analytica-before-it-was-cool.html">described</a> as a kind of &#x201C;psyops contractor.&#x201D; Whistleblower <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5g6IJm7YJQ">Christopher Wylie alleges</a> that the company exists merely to allow politics-obsessed billionaires, like Robert Mercer or Vincent Tchenguiz, to skirt FEC regulations by passing their money to contractors like SCL, rather than giving directly to campaigns.</p><p>The majority of the calls referenced Republican candidates who had enlisted Cambridge Analytica and SCL&#x2019;s services in 2014. One Colorado resident described the numerous calls they had received from &#x201C;SCL Elections,&#x201D; which often took the form of a four question &#x201C;political survey.&#x201D; The caller noted that the surveys often mentioned the then-candidate Cory Gardner, who went on to defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Udall in the 2014 Colorado Senate election later that year:</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--block" data-hash="130442652"><span>Political survey. I have gotten several of these calls. They all claim to be four question surveys. The first question was am I a Republican or Democrat. Second was do I vote every election. Third questions was do I always vote party line. Fourth question was how excited am I about the upcoming election. Subsequent calls have been variations on this theme but they usually ask me if I would vote for Cory Gardiner for Governor. I assume these are funded by his committee and if you answer yes you&apos;ll be asked for a campaign contribution. Other variations have asked me how conservative I am and how conservative I think Cory Gardiner is.
