In 2017, the school was rocked by a <a href="../5721/racism-free-speech-evergreen-state-college.html">controversy over racism on campus</a> that brought protests from the left, threats of violence from the right, and made the school a national focal point for bad-faith gripes from conservatives about &#x201C;free speech.&#x201D; The situation was fraught enough that Evergreen State campus police successfully used the tension as a pretext to arm themselves with semi-automatic rifles, which they&#x2019;d made multiple failed attempts at obtaining since 2007.</p><p>There was no announcement of the policy change; the greater Evergreen population only learned about the purchase of the new weaponry from the school&#x2019;s student newspaper, the <a href="http://www.cooperpointjournal.com/2018/10/17/police-services-have-ar-15-rifles-president-bridges-quietly-approved-purchase-in-2017/"><em>Cooper Point Journal</em></a>, in October 2018, a year after they were first purchased. CPJ reporter Forest Hunt told <em>The Outline</em> that he only found out about the AR-15s when another student observed the weapons in a campus police car.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if having more weapons on campus will make anything safer for anybody,&#x201D; an Evergreen student named Cameron told the <em>CPJ</em>. &#x201C;I think it will escalate the situation.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="xxPBQprP"></div><p>But the school is standing by in its decision to arm its law-enforcement officers. &#x201C;Across the U.S., mass shootings and threats of violence on college campuses have sadly become more common in recent years,&#x201D; Allison Anderson, the school&#x2019;s public relations manager, told <em>The Outline</em> in an email. &#x201C;Evergreen&#x2019;s law enforcement officers have the same standard-issue police equipment, including rifles, that their counterparts at the University of Washington and other campus police have at public universities throughout the state.

Davis told the <em>Globe</em> that their reason for doing so was simple, if you &#x201C;watch CNN for five minutes.&#x201D; In the same article it was revealed that officers at nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Tufts University, and University of Massachusetts Boston also carry semi-automatic rifles.</p><p>In a 2016 <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/police-fire/Police-on-campuses-bring-out-big-guns-12687348">interview</a>, Indiana University &#x2014; Purdue University Fort Wayne campus Chief of Police, Julie Yunker, cited a shooting at nearby Northern Illinois University as the reason her officers needed nine AR-15s so as not to be caught unawares. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t run out of ammunition,&#x201D; Yunker told Fort Wayne&#x2019;s <em>Journal Gazette</em>.</p><p>These increases in on-campus weaponry were not isolated incidents, as this <a href="https://www.apnews.com/c69129d5b15640bebca4ee6c59b66024">2016 <em>Associated Press</em> report</a> shows.

A similar <a href="http://www.cooperpointjournal.com/2013/01/31/pass-holds-forum-to-discuss-assault-rifle-petition/">attempt in 2013</a> by police to carry arms at Evergreen also failed.</p><p>Everything changed in 2017, when emails between (now-former) Evergreen biology professor Bret Weinstein and Rashida Love, the school&#x2019;s director of First Peoples Advising Services, were <a href="http://www.cooperpointjournal.com/2017/04/10/dl-on-the-faculty-dl-update-on-the-email-chain/">made public</a> by the <em>CPJ</em>. In the emails, Weinstein objected to the school&#x2019;s annual &#x201C;Day of Absence/Day of Presence&#x201D; event, which has been a fixture on the campus <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/05/30/escalating-debate-race-evergreen-state-students-demand-firing-professor">since the &#x2018;70s</a>, and consists of students of color making themselves &#x201C;absent&#x201D; from campus to show what the school would be like without them. Weinstein&#x2019;s comments led a number of students to confront the professor outside of his classroom in late May, and the professor was portrayed as a victim in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/opinion/sunday/bruni-campus-inquisitions-evergreen-state.html">two</a> opinion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/opinion/when-the-left-turns-on-its-own.html">pieces</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><div class="youtube-embed" data-type="inline"><div class="youtube-embed__video"><div class="youtube-embed__video__wrapper"><div class="youtube-embed__video__element"><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class="z9" data-id="jUW9OhWM"></div><p>The attention from two articles in the nation&#x2019;s paper of record was followed by a mini-documentary from <em>VICE</em> (above) and an <a href="https://youtu.be/_j9nFced_eo">appearance</a> by Weinstein on Tucker Carlson&#x2019;s show on Fox News, which rocketed Weinstein and the Evergreen situation into the American media stratosphere. That attention translated into threats. That June; a man <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/new-jersey-man-accused-of-threats-that-closed-evergreen-state-college-last-month/">later identified</a> as Robert W. Kerekes, Jr. of New Jersey, phoned the school and <a href="https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/education/article154085684.html">declared</a>, &#x201C;I am on my way to Evergreen [State] now with a .44 Magnum,&#x201D; and was going to &#x201C;execute as many people on that campus as I can get ahold of.&#x201D; Though the threat turned out to be a hoax, the campus was shut down for two days for public safety purposes, and the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/evergreen-moves-graduation-ceremony-to-tacoma/">school moved its graduation ceremony</a> to Tacoma&#x2019;s Cheney Stadium some 30 miles away, where attendees had to cross through metal detectors to enter the venue. Changing the venue cost <a href="https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/education/article156238529.html">around $100,000</a>, according to <em>The Olympian</em> newspaper.</p><p>Patriot Prayer, a right-wing extremist group that operates in the Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington area (Olympia is two hours north of the former and an hour south of the latter) had already planned a rally for June 4 in nearby Portland. Once the controversy over Weinstein went national, Patriot Prayer announced it would focus at least some of the energy from its &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; event at Evergreen. Patriot Prayer held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vDIFrPkGdc">demonstration</a> at the college nearly two weeks later, clashing with anti-fascist counter-protesters.</p><p>The state legislature, citing the Weinstein unrest, renewed their drive to arm Evergreen&#x2019;s police. By then, the school was the last remaining public college or university in Washington at which police were not armed with high-powered rifles. After a Republican-led discussion regarding the alleged quashing of dissenting voices on campus by the left, lawmakers began raised concerns over potential active shooters on campus and recommended to Bridges that he arm his police force.</p><p>During the <a href="https://q13fox.com/2017/06/20/tensions-at-evergreen-state-college-still-raw-as-lawmakers-hold-hearing/">roughly 90-minute hearing</a>, Bridges and the then-campus police chief, Stacy Brown, answered a number of questions from lawmakers about the the tense situation on campus.</p><p>One point of agreement between the lawmakers and Brown was that campus police ought to be armed with rifles. Brown informed the committee that the reason the college was the only state university in Washington without AR-15s or similar rifles was &#x201C;philosophical&#x201D; and a decision made by the administration. &#x201C;We should have rifles, in my opinion,&#x201D; Brown <a href="https://www.tvw.org/watch/?eventID=2017061052">told</a> the committee.</p><p>Six months later, campus police got their guns.</p><hr class="hr"><p>Some on campus say that the weapons are just another part of a greater problem. In an interview conducted last summer, the Evergreen Political Economy professor and activist Peter Bohmer told <em>The Outline</em> that the new guns couldn&#x2019;t be seen in a vacuum. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s definitely a history of a critical view towards the police&#x201D; on campus, Bohmer said. Police treatment of young black men in the greater Olympia community has been a focal point of unrest at the school. A 2008 concert by the political hip-hop group dead prez ended with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/evergreen-state-college-divided-after-riot/">rioters destroying a police car</a> in impromptu protest in response to police detaining a black man during a scuffle. In May of 2015, an Olympia police officer <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/cop-wont-face-charges-in-shooting-of-2-alleged-shoplifters-in-olympia-5/">shot</a> two young black men near a local SafeWay, leading to more protests when it became apparent that the officer would not be charged. Without the historical context for the mood at the school when the Weinstein situation exploded &#x2014; particularly as a result of the police shooting in 2015 &#x2014; Bohmer told <em>The Outline</em>, it&#x2019;s impossible to understand why things happened in the way they did.</p><p>Even in light of these tensions, the campus community believes that the situation does not rise to the point of police needing to arm themselves with semi-automatic weapons. This January, an Evergreen student named Nicolas Jefferys <a href="http://www.cooperpointjournal.com/2019/01/23/rifle-round-up-admin-explains-decisions/">told</a> the <em>Cooper Point Journal</em> that adding high-powered weapons to the already uneasy relationship between campus police and the study body could lead to catastrophe down the line. &#x201C;I worry about other people who look like me being murdered by campus police because the AR-15s,&#x201D; said Jeffreys.</p> </div> </article> <div class="post-micronative-footer"></div> <div class="post-footer"></div> </div> </div> </path-page> </div> </path-element> </path-plane> </path-root> </main> <div class="navigation"> <nav class="navigation__menu"> <a class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--logo" href="../../index.html" aria-label="Back to homepage"> <span class="icon icon-logo"></span> </a> <button class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--hamburger" type="button" aria-label="Open menu"> <span class="icon icon-menu"></span> </button> </nav> <div class="menu"> <button type="button" class="menu__close-button" aria-label="Close menu"> <span class="icon icon-close"></span> </button> <div class="menu__wrapper"> <h1 class="logo menu__logo" data-color="black"> <a class="logo__link menu__logo__link" href="../../index.html"> <span>The Outline</span> </a> </h1> <div class="menu__links"> <div class="menu__outmojis__wrapper"> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/recent.html"> Recent </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/power.html"> Power </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/culture.html"> Culture </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/future.html"> Future </a> <div class="menu__outmojis"> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="1"></div> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="2"></div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="menu__footer"> <div class="menu__social"> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-facebook"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.twitter.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-twitter"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.instagram.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-instagram"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/outline?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-youtube"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://flipboard.com/@TheOutline?utm_campaign=tools&amp;utm_medium=follow&amp;utm_source=theoutline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-flipboard"></span> </a> </div> <div class="menu__footer__links"> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> About </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://www.bustle.com/info/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Legal </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://jobs.lever.co/bustle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Jobs </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../tips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Got A Tip?
