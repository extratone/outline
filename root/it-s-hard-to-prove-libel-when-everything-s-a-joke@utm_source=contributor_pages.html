However, Berger may find that a libel claim, if he decides to pursue it, is extremely hard to prove in court &#x2014; and possibly even more so given the statements took place on Twitter.</p><hr class="hr"><div class="z9" data-id="0fjBejTK"></div><p>There are four basic tests of libel: Is the statement false? Would the statement be perceived by a reasonable person as an assertion of fact? Did the statement do damage to a reputation? And finally, did the perpetrator realize the statement was false (or, in some cases, was the perpetrator negligent in figuring out if the statement was false)?</p><p>There is a classic hypothetical example used to illustrate libel for law students. A man writes a letter to a woman&#x2019;s fiance in which he alleges inaccurately that the woman has had a series of sexual partners that her betrothed didn&#x2019;t know about. The husband-to-be, scandalized and devastated, breaks off the engagement. His fiance is heartbroken, but at least she has a legal claim: The statement was false; it was expressed as fact, not opinion; the letter-writer had no reason to believe it was true; and it hurt the woman&#x2019;s reputation. She can sue, and if she lives in one of the dozen or so states where libel is also a criminal offense, she can prosecute.</p><p>But what if, instead of a letter, the accuser sent a tweet?</p><div class="z9" data-id="0xCvfCwe"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Documenting some of the abuse I&apos;ve been dealing w/ because of Mike Cernovich&apos;s libeling &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a>&apos;s refusal to take action. <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">@jack</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Support">@support</a><a href="https://t.co/xkkhr7LwLE">pic.twitter.com/xkkhr7LwLE</a></p>&#x2014; Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) <a href="https://twitter.com/VicBergerIV/status/810516154435387393">December 18, 2016</a></blockquote><p>Libel law isn&#x2019;t supposed to change based on the method of communication. Under the law, a statement in a letter is no different from a statement published in a newspaper or on video. However, only statements of fact can be libel. Jokes, opinions, and even statements that the author mistakenly believed to be true are protected. So if your statement is made in a setting that judges and juries think of as a freewheeling circus for insults, gags, and ephemera, it gets tough to prove a libel claim.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="17691039"><span>&#x201C;The method of communication can be relevant if it&#x2019;s a setting normally reserved for jokes and opinions.&#x201D;</span></blockquote><p>&#x201C;Courts are a little more likely to find statements on Twitter, especially statements on Twitter by random joes, to be perceived by a reasonable person to be expressing opinions,&#x201D; said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA who specializes in the First Amendment. &#x201C;The method of communication can be relevant if it&#x2019;s a setting normally reserved for jokes and opinions.&#x201D;</p><p>Volokh was not directly familiar with the Berger-Cernovich spat. However, he gave some examples of similar hypothetical statements and posited some possible libel defenses:</p><p><strong>Statement:</strong> &#x201C;I happen to know that so-and-so is a pedophile.&#x201D; <br><strong>Defense:</strong> If false, this statement is libelous &#x2014; unless the author has reason to believe it&#x2019;s true. &#x201C;Reasonable mistake of fact even when you&#x2019;re talking about a private figure is a defense in most cases,&#x201D; Volohk said.</p><p><strong>Statement:</strong> &#x201C;This guy would probably love to have sex with little children. He doesn&#x2019;t say he&#x2019;s doing it, but I&#x2019;ll bet he&#x2019;s doing it.&#x201D; <br><strong>Defense:</strong> The author is expressing an opinion &#x2014; &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll bet&#x201D; &#x2014; but they haven&#x2019;t asserted as fact that the subject is having sex with little children.</p><p><strong>Statement:</strong> &#x201C;Based on the things this guy has said, it makes me think he&#x2019;s a pedophile.&#x201D; <br><strong>Defense:</strong> This is similarly protected because it is an opinion about a fact, not an assertion of fact.</p><p><strong>Statement:</strong> &#x201C;The guy talks about how he&#x2019;s a libertarian, and I think all libertarians are pedophiles, so he must be part of a pedophile ring.&#x201D; <br><strong>Defense:</strong> This is a statement of opinion, though a stupid one.</p><p>There are other reasons why a libel lawsuit is usually unproductive, Volokh said. Defamation lawsuits are long and expensive, and your average Twitter user may have no assets worth collecting. &#x201C;If somebody&#x2019;s libeling you and they don&#x2019;t have any money, then it becomes very hard for you to sue,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The threat of damages isn&#x2019;t going to be a deterrent for these people.&#x201D; A lawsuit is also likely to bring more attention to the defamatory claim in the first place, especially if the user has a small following.</p><hr class="hr"><p>There have been at least a dozen notable cases of Twitter-native libel filed in the US, but as far as I could find, no jury has ever ruled that a statement made on Twitter was libel &#x2014; and in almost every case, the fact that Twitter is an unserious environment was brought up either in court or in media coverage.</p><p>&#x201C;One could argue that reasonable readers of most Twitter feeds do not understand &#x2018;tweets&#x2019; to be conveying factual information,&#x201D; Sam Bayard of <em>Deadline Reporter</em> wrote <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/blog/2009/sam-bayard/first-twitter-libel-suit-starring-courtney-love">in 2009</a> when Courtney Love was first sued over statements she made on Twitter and elsewhere. This &#x201C;extreme informality&#x201D; of Twitter isn&#x2019;t enough to squash a libel claim on its own, but it provides a lot of cover.</p><p>In 2009, Horizon Group Management sued tenant Amanda Bonnen for tweeting, &quot;Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was bad for you?

The case was expected to set a precedent for what some were calling &#x201C;Twibel,&#x201D; until it was dismissed by a judge who ruled that &quot;the gist&quot; of the statement was true and any other statements were opinions based on those facts.</p><p>&#x201C;The dismissal of <em>Darm</em> means that US courts have yet to rule on a Twibel case,&#x201D; Ellyn Angelotti Kamke, an attorney in Florida who writes about media law, wrote in a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/documents/jhtl_publications/ANGELOTTI-MACROFINALFINAL.pdf">paper</a> about libel in the context of Twitter in 2013. &#x201C;Due to the informal nature of the platform, as seen in these cases, much of what appears on Twitter is incapable of fulfilling the requirements of a defamation claim.&#x201D;</p><p>Recently, a Twitter libel case seemed on track to go to trial. In early 2016, the actor James Woods filed a $10 million defamation suit against the pseudonymous Twitter user named &#x201C;Abe List.&#x201D; Abe tweeted &#x201C;cocaine addict James Woods still sniffing and spouting.&#x201D; Woods argued that this was damaging to his reputation. A judge allowed the initial claim to proceed, but the plaintiff, who was never unmasked, <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/james-woods-cheers-dropped-appeal-940364">died shortly thereafter</a>.</p><p>The defense had planned to argue that Abe&#x2019;s tweet was not a statement of fact. &#x201C;The defense was that it was the hyperbole of Twitter,&#x201D; said Lisa Bloom, one of Abe&#x2019;s attorneys. &#x201C;In the context of Twitter, insults will get thrown back and forth. Our argument was that no one could really think that Abe was trying to make a factual claim that James Woods was a drug user.&#x201D;</p><p>There was one case in which a claim of Twitter libel made it all the way to a jury. In 2011, Courtney Love was sued by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes over a tweet Love sent to a journalist saying Holmes was &#x201C;bought off.&#x201D; The jury <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/24/local/la-me-love-libel-20140125">decided</a> in favor of Love because Love did not know the statement was false.</p><hr class="hr"><p>In a Periscope broadcast, Mike Cernovich directed the attention of more than 11,000 viewers to Vic Berger&#x2019;s Twitter profile. &#x201C;This could be an actual pedophile ring.

Ken White, an attorney with Brown White &amp; Osborn who also represented Abe List against James Woods, declined to be interviewed for this story when he learned it was tied to Cernovich.

The tweets accused Simorangkir of being a &quot;nasty, lying, hosebag thief,&#x201D; having &quot;a history of dealing cocaine,&#x201D; and having &quot;lost all custody of her child,&#x201D; among other things. There was never a ruling on whether the tweets could be taken as statements of fact. Love <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/courtney-love-ends-defamation-row-818025">settled</a> out of court for $430,000.</p><p><strong>In 2011</strong>, Sanford Siegal, the founder of the &#x201C;Cookie Diet,&#x201D; sued Kim Kardashian for <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/12/exclusive-kim-kardashian-sued-cookie-diet-maker-read-lawsuit/">tweeting</a> that the diet was unhealthy. &#x201C;Dr. Siegal&apos;s Cookie Diet is falsely promoting that I&apos;m on this diet.
