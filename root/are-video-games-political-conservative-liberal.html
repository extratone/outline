At the National Security Council under Ronald Reagan, he helped manage a number of violent imperial operations, including the U.S. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-24-me-3871-story.html">invasion of Grenada</a>. Due to televised hearings in the Summer of 1987 where he gave horrifying testimony about the things that he and the United States government had allegedly done, he is probably best known for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal.</p><p>Alternatively, you might instead recognize North as a minor character from <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>. In the game, he makes an appearance, service ribbons and all, to talk a retired Alex Mason &#x2014; the game&#x2019;s protagonist &#x2014; into joining a covert mission in Angola. The cameo was accompanied by North&#x2019;s role as an advisor and <a href="https://kotaku.com/watch-oliver-north-shill-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-5906866">pitchman</a> for the 2012 title. It was very bizarre, and, according to the developers, not at <em>all</em> political.</p><p>In an interview with Treyarch head Mark Lamia, <em>Kotaku</em>&#x2019;s Stephen Totilo asked if the studio had expected the controversy around using North as a consultant. &#x201C;We&apos;re not trying to make a political statement with our game,&#x201D; Lamia <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-creators-say-oliver-north-helped-make-thei-5913092">responded.</a> &#x201C;We&apos;re trying to make a piece of art and entertainment.&#x201D; This answer would be farcical under any circumstances, but to be clear, <em>Black Ops II</em> was already a jingoistic first-person shooter in a series full of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4x44yp/theres-no-reason-for-no-russian-to-exist-in-modern-warfare-2">dubious storylines</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-pentagon-adviser">straight-up</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=72v7PWJUyxY">propaganda</a>. Its writer and director, Dave Anthony, would later go on to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/22/call-of-duty-gaming-role-military-entertainment-complex">fellowship</a> at D.C.&#x2019;s Atlantic Council, <a href="https://vimeo.com/138549200">advising</a> on &#x201C;The Future of Unknown Conflict.&#x201D; Regardless, Lamia felt comfortable insisting on record that there was nothing political about getting the Iran-Contra fall guy to shill for its game.</p><div class="z9" data-id="Ykn9w3ok"></div><div class="youtube-embed" data-type="inline"><div class="youtube-embed__video"><div class="youtube-embed__video__wrapper"><div class="youtube-embed__video__element"><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXnmcRUsccU?enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div></div><p>In the time since, this brazen corporate line has become the standard for blockbuster games, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/video-interview/2019/08/07/why-infinity-ward-doesnt-consider-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-a">including</a> the upcoming <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>. &#x201C;Are games political?&#x201D; continues to be exhaustingly rehashed, because game companies continue to sell an apolitical delusion.

No matter how the themes are handled, these are games about a multinational peacekeeping force (<em>Overwatch</em>), an android uprising in a real city with a real history of racism (<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>), and an actual World War <em>(Battlefield V</em>). <em>Outer Worlds</em> is centered around narrative-controlling megacorporations taking over the galaxy. <em>The Division 2</em> and <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> involve speculative warfare in the Tom Clancy extended universe &#x2014; the conservative version of <em>The West Wing</em>, as Wyman joked &#x2014; including the sequel to a game that caused the Bolivian government to file a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-france-videogames-idUSKBN1692PK">formal complaint</a> with the French embassy.

Where it felt short, as much of the discussion of the phenomenon does, was its deeper analysis of the landscape. &#x201C;While games tend to take a broadly progressive view of the world, game company marketing departments understand that explicitly stating hostility toward reactionary positions risks the enmity of right wing media, streamers and online communities,&#x201D; Campbell wrote. &#x201C;They fear, above all, finding themselves at the center of a Gamergate-like publicity inferno.&#x201D;</p><div class="z9" data-id="y60zXQcV"></div><p>But there&#x2019;s no evidence that the AAA games space &#x2014; where this marketing is most prevalent &#x2014; trends towards progressivism at all. Its biggest products include military shooters with names like <em>Infinite Warfare</em>, the edgelord nihilism of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, zero-sum <a href="../6325/fortnite-logic-of-scarcity.html">battles for resources</a> like <em>Fortnite</em>, and glorified advertisements for men&#x2019;s sports cartels that enrich oligarch owners and shoe company CEOs. Beyond that, the industry spent decades actively creating the <a href="https://reallifemag.com/well-played-game-boys/">environment</a> for those reactionary positions to thrive. The mistake is viewing this as an unseemly aberration, rather than a fundamental aspect of the business.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="20125881"><span>&#x201C;All Gamergate did was put a name to something that was always there.&#x201D;</span><footer class="pullquote__attribution">&#x2014; <cite>Art critic Lana Polansky</cite></footer></blockquote><p>The ESA <a href="https://www.theesa.com/esa-research/2019-essential-facts-about-the-computer-and-video-game-industry/">reports</a> that 65 percent of American adults play video games.

These companies are actively responsible for shaping and catering to that belief, and for the last five years, the unavoidable reference point for that hardline, conservative population has been Gamergate. As formative as it was, discussing the problem of gaming&#x2019;s toxic right wing primarily in terms of a 2014 harassment campaign has become an easy scapegoat for trends that began <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/8/15/4622252/plague-of-game-dev-harassment-erodes-industry-spurs-support-groups">far earlier</a>, and have not only continued but <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844">seeped into everything else</a>.</p><div class="z9" data-id="SzfftLmM"></div><p>This climate has been building since at least the mid-1980s, when women were <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">squeezed</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/">out</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/19/women-built-tech-industry-then-they-were-pushed-out/">of computer science</a> roles, and in the wake of a crash that nearly collapsed the industry, video games rebranded themselves as toys sold <a href="https://timeline.com/plundered-hearts-amy-briggs-7c8699847bed">almost</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/145594/video-games-gendered">exclusively</a> to boys.

As Tracey Lien described in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed"><em>Polygon</em></a>, this created a &#x201C;chicken and egg&#x201D; feedback loop that continues today.</p><p>It also nurtured a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html">hostile</a> environment for everyone outside that narrow focus, despite the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/">realities</a> of who plays games. &#x201C;All Gamergate did was put a name to something that was always there,&#x201D; Lana Polansky, an <a href="https://sufficientlyhuman.com/">art critic</a> who specializes in the obscure fringes of gaming, told me. &#x201C;But if you look at a lot of the central figures of that whole thing, they were the same people that harassed <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/">Kathy Sierra</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-writer-describes-her-gaming-tastes-angry-gamer-5886674">Jennifer Halper</a>, and <a href="https://jezebel.com/gaming-industry-is-full-of-sexist-geeks-333238">Jade Raymond</a>, and all the other women before us that got horribly treated by the industry and by their fans.&#x201D; The end result is a development force that is disproportionately male and where non-white workers, particularly black and Latinx ones, are heavily <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.igda.org/resource/resmgr/2017_DSS_/!IGDA_DSS_2017_SummaryReport.pdf">underrepresented</a>.

Video games&#x2019; popularity grew hand in hand with improvements in resolution, computing power, and other former <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/why-are-video-games-so-big/">technical bottlenecks</a> that would allow for grandiose, sprawling productions. Big-name, AAA games bloated into enormous IPs, built by armies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/opinion/video-games-layoffs-union.html">exploited</a> labor and <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make-1818508211">mountains</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/24/why-video-games-are-so-expensive-to-develop">of capital</a>. The number of studios capable of supporting these projects and their overall output has dwindled, while the size of the teams needed to build them has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708122249/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/417770/triple-a-console-studios-declined-by-80-this-gen-says-ea-exec/">inflated into</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-02-26-on-reflections-first-interview-with-the-ubisoft-studios-new-md">the hundreds</a>. By 2012, <em>Assassin&apos;s Creed 3</em> creative director Alex Hutchinson was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev/1100-6365381/">already calling</a> the growth &#x201C;cancerous&#x201D; and fearing a future where every game would either be algorithmically tailored to make money or a &#x201C;massive arms race&#x201D; for even bigger experiences with even better graphics. Hutchinson, clearly, was right. It may not be <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-video-game-industry-cant-go-on-like-this-1836606033">sustainable</a>, either in our <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/black-friday-warning-video-games-wa-2008-11-28/">actual</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/high-techs-crucial-rare-earth-elements-are-already-running-low-133603653/">ecosystem</a> or one where C-level executives continue making eight figures a year, uninterrupted.</p><p>At this scale, games have become both tremendously risk-averse and brutally neoliberal. They require a vast, heterogeneous player base to pay off their massive investment but are more intent than ever on accommodating their zealous orthodox wing. They attempt to be everything to everyone, while still maintaining their necessarily conservative core. Designed as accessory slot machines, neverending serials, and forever games-as-a-service, they&#x2019;re meant to generate revenue indefinitely. Some of them are meticulously crafted, incredible experiences &#x2014; this is the industry that still made <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> &#x2014; but even so, their visions are filtered through scores of people, layers of market considerations, and always those persistent assumptions about what gamers are and what they want out of games.</p><p>In a largely excellent <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-division-2-and-the-severing-of-politics-from-video-games">article</a> on the severing of games and politics for <em>The New Yorker</em>, Simon Parkin wrote, &#x201C;The inability of blockbuster video games to present a coherent political message is, to some degree, a result of the way in which they are constructed.&#x201D; This is not wrong exactly, nor are the ideas he cites from game developers Robert Yang and Paolo Pedercini about huge productions watering down ambitious concepts and the lack of support structures for more unconventional games. These are points which Polansky agrees with, too. What it misses, though, is that even in denying their connection to politics or arriving at muddled artistic visions, the message that the majority of them are delivering is crystal clear.</p><p>These games are declaring that the status quo is not politics, and that anything challenging it is a frivolous coincidence for entertainment purposes only. These companies are announcing loudly, in spite of any user statistics, that their games are <em>for True Gamers</em>. They will keep playing all angles and claiming they&#x2019;re nonpartisan for as long as the market allows. &#x201C;It&apos;s like watching any network television show where it&apos;s insanely reactionary, presented as liberal,&#x201D; said Polansky. &#x201C;There&apos;s character sliders so you can modify your character to look however you want, and that&apos;s cool and all. But at the end of the day, you&apos;re still murdering brown people overseas and that&apos;s the game.&#x201D; What could possibly be political about that?</p> <div class="post__credits"> Josh Tucker is a freelance writer for outlets including <em>Deadspin</em>, <em>Kotaku</em>, <em>Waypoint</em>, <em>SBNation</em>, <em>Pastime</em>, <em>Vice Sports</em>, and <em>The Classical</em>. </div> </div> </article> <div class="post-micronative-footer"></div> <div class="post-footer"></div> </div> </div> </path-page> </div> </path-element> </path-plane> </path-root> </main> <div class="navigation"> <nav class="navigation__menu"> <a class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--logo" href="../../index.html" aria-label="Back to homepage"> <span class="icon icon-logo"></span> </a> <button class="navigation__menu__item navigation__menu__item--hamburger" type="button" aria-label="Open menu"> <span class="icon icon-menu"></span> </button> </nav> <div class="menu"> <button type="button" class="menu__close-button" aria-label="Close menu"> <span class="icon icon-close"></span> </button> <div class="menu__wrapper"> <h1 class="logo menu__logo" data-color="black"> <a class="logo__link menu__logo__link" href="../../index.html"> <span>The Outline</span> </a> </h1> <div class="menu__links"> <div class="menu__outmojis__wrapper"> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/recent.html"> Recent </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/power.html"> Power </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/culture.html"> Culture </a> <a class="menu__link" href="../../topic/future.html"> Future </a> <div class="menu__outmojis"> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="1"></div> <div class="menu__outmojis__set" data-set="2"></div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="menu__footer"> <div class="menu__social"> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-facebook"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.twitter.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-twitter"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.instagram.com/outline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-instagram"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/outline?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-youtube"></span> </a> <a class="menu__social__link" href="https://flipboard.com/@TheOutline?utm_campaign=tools&amp;utm_medium=follow&amp;utm_source=theoutline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> <span class="icon icon-flipboard"></span> </a> </div> <div class="menu__footer__links"> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> About </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://www.bustle.com/info/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Legal </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="https://jobs.lever.co/bustle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Jobs </a> <a class="menu__footer__link" href="../../tips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-hidden="true"> Got A Tip?
