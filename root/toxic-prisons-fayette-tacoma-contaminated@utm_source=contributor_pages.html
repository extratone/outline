maximum-security SCI Fayette prison in 2008, he started getting sick. The air outside was so contaminated that his nose kept closing up. Then came the weight loss, followed by the gastrointestinal problems. Pretty soon, Mosley was relying on asthma masks to breathe. &#x201C;I was going back and forth to medical trying to get some kind of relief or diagnosis,&#x201D; he told <em>The Outline</em>. &#x201C;I think I went maybe 35, 40 times.&#x201D;</p><p>Mosley, a Philadelphia native and self-described &#x201C;health nut,&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t used to falling ill. Before coming to SCI Fayette, he rarely even caught colds. But he says all of the doctors he saw at SCI Fayette insisted that his health problems weren&#x2019;t real. &#x201C;They kept telling me, &#x2018;Oh, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with you. It&#x2019;s psychosomatic. You&#x2019;re imagining it.&#x2019;&#x201D; At one point, he says a doctor blamed his failing health on allergies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mosley started writing letters to local officials three days per week. &#x201C;I was making a big stink,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If I was going to die there, I wasn&#x2019;t going to die quietly.&#x201D; He knew something was wrong. All around him, inmates were suffering. Skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, and breathing issues were common across the prison. Everyone had a runny nose. The water quality was so abhorrent that guards brought bottled water for their onsite patrol dogs, according to Mosley. But the inmates still had to drink from the tap.</p><div class="z9" data-id="aF6Qq55i"></div><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="Richard Mosley" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-WNfcLV401sY34GGBiJun?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=dd42d833f144e13b5757debf2c31224e" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-WNfcLV401sY34GGBiJun?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=3c955d0d411799d82086c62105847b4c 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-WNfcLV401sY34GGBiJun?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=5ff181aef71a38e4a5f649aa9d864bfa 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> Richard Mosley <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Courtesy of Richard Mosley</span></p></div><p>Only after he completed his sentence in 2012 and received a phone call from the Pennsylvania-based advocacy group Abolitionist Law Center did Mosley finally learn what was making him sick.</p><p>SCI Fayette was built in 2003 on the edge of a coal-ash dump for a nearby mine. Winds regularly sent that ash, which contained arsenic, lead, and mercury, into the air around the prison, and SCI Fayette inmates who inhaled it for a sustained period of time reported respiratory problems. Longer-term risks included thyroid cancer and lung disease.</p><div class="z9" data-id="bOL0CCqI"></div><p>The ash also seeped into the water, creating elevated levels of trihalomethanes, a carcinogen produced from a reaction between the ash and chlorine, according to a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxd9y/ashes-to-ashes-0000651-v22n5"><em>VICE</em> report</a> from 2015. Local residents were warned of these risks; the people incarcerated at SCI Fayette were not. (Though the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxd9y/ashes-to-ashes-0000651-v22n5">conducted</a> tests showing that the water meets drinking standards, environmental activists have questioned its limited methodological scope.)</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="100805376"><span>&#x201C;If I was going to die there, I wasn&#x2019;t going to die quietly.&#x201D;</span><footer class="pullquote__attribution">&#x2014; <cite>Richard Mosley, an imate at SCI Fayette from 2008 to 2012</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Despite resistance from activist groups, state and federal prisons continue to be built in dangerous environments that imperil the health of inmates. In March, President Donald Trump <a href="http://bostonreview.net/law-justice/sylvia-ryerson-judah-schept-building-prisons-appalachia">allocated</a> an unprecedented $510 million to construct a federal prison in Kentucky, the most expensive prison project in U.S. history.

They also discovered that from 2008 to 2011 the California State Prison in Lancaster was home to a soil-based fungus that causes valley fever, a respiratory infection that is especially dangerous for black and Filipino inmates. (The fungus is most dangerous when it disseminates out of the lungs and throughout the body. A 2011 study showed Black people are 14 times <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012635/">more likely</a> than their white counterparts to experience dissemination, while Filipinos are 175 times more likely.) In California&#x2019;s Kern Valley State Prison, which has air quality levels below the minimum set by the Clean Air Act, a black inmate who contracted valley fever <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/05/behind-bars-on-polluted-land/484202/">sued</a> the state for a hate crime &#x2014; its negligence, the inmate argued, imperiled the prison&#x2019;s disproportionately black population.

For 21 years, Cotter actively produced and stored radioactive chemicals like uranium, vanadium, and molybdenum.

By 1987, Cotter was home to more than 3.5 million tons of radioactive waste, and much of that was stored in lined ponds &#x2014; which are usually around 40 feet deep &#x2014; meant to keep materials from leaking out.</p><p>But the materials did seep out. The Colorado Attorney General&#x2019;s Office documented more than 70 leaks at Cotter from 1980 to 1986, according to historian Robert Perkinson&#x2019;s 1994 paper &#x201C;Shackled Justice: Florence Federal Penitentiary and the New Politics of Punishment,&#x201D; which was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/29766829?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">published</a> in the journal <em>Social Justice</em>. The leaks led the EPA to declare the Cotter Uranium Mill a Superfund site in 1984. Shortly before ADX Florence was built, EPA reports <a href="http://solitarywatch.com/2015/09/10/toxic-traps-environmental-hazards-threaten-two-federal-supermax-prisons/">identified</a> elevated levels of molybdenum, uranium, radium, radon gas, polonium, selenium, and sulfate in the water, almost certainly as a result of Cotter&#x2019;s spills. But the EPA does not have the final say in land use decisions.</p><p>On his arrival at ADX Florence in 1995, Levasseur saw these health risks firsthand. In an email to <em>The Outline</em>, he described a friend, Skip, who developed a tumor on his calf &#x201C;the size of a grapefruit&#x201D; before being transferred to Missouri for medical attention. He died soon after. Though Skip was only in his thirties, &#x201C;his sister wrote me that the body looked 90 years old,&#x201D; Levasseur said. Another friend, who Levasseur called Poochie, died in his bunk after guards failed to notice that he wasn&#x2019;t getting up to eat meals. Levasseur never learned his cause of death. And a man Levasseur called &#x201C;AB&#x201D; developed small lumps across his body during his time at ADX.</p><p>Levasseur&#x2019;s knowledge of what other inmates experienced was limited by design. Because he was in near-constant solitary confinement, &#x201C;a prisoner could drop dead a hundred yards from me and I wouldn&apos;t find out about it for a long time, if ever,&#x201D; he said.</p><div class="photo-embed" data-alignment data-text="true" data-type="inline"><div class="photo-embed__image"><div class="photo-embed__image__wrapper"><img alt="ADX Florence" class="lazy" data-src="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-kINePCXz6MV9ACOaL6IA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=1280&amp;s=9d56c96168c23d61e94e38fe29c39c3b" data-srcset="https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-kINePCXz6MV9ACOaL6IA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=750&amp;s=ee703ed58a187aaa1a334e1f7af234af 750w, https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180716-kINePCXz6MV9ACOaL6IA?auto=format&amp;q=60&amp;w=2000&amp;s=7136bf22d59bc786f96dc8eaa6d27bee 2000w"></div></div><p class="photo-embed__caption"> ADX Florence <span class="photo-embed__caption__byline">Public Domain</span></p></div><p>Though it&apos;s impossible to know exactly what called Levasseur&apos;s friends&apos; illnesses, other prisoners made known their concerns about the water. Oscar L&#xF3;pez Rivera, a Puerto Rican activist who helped lead a bombing campaign against the U.S. in the 1970s and 80s, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mBSU3ihlO3gC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=%22toxic%20water%22&amp;f=false">wrote</a> in his diary in 1996, &#x201C;i will spend the rest of my time in prison drinking the dioxin-contaminated toxic water every day&#x2014;a very dangerous carcinogenic substance.&#x201D; Rivera feared that the contaminants at ADX Florence would degrade his health: &#x201C;Since the average time that the prisoners spend here is 3 1/2 years maybe the dioxin hasn&#x2019;t affected them that much. But i&#x2019;ve already been here 8 1/2 years.&#x201D; Rivera, who is now 75, was released last year after President Obama pardoned him.</p><p>The EPA still lists Cotter as a Superfund site, but the contamination concerns in Ca&#xF1;on City and Florence appear to be dwindling thanks to cleanup efforts (the site isn&#x2019;t expected to lose Superfund status until at least 2027). &#x201C;Potential public exposures are below regulatory limits,&#x201D; Jennifer Opila, Radiation Program Manager at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, told <em>The Outline</em>.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--inline" data-hash="8716632"><span> &#x201C;A prisoner could drop dead a hundred yards from me and I wouldn&apos;t find out about it for a long time, if ever.&quot;</span><footer class="pullquote__attribution">&#x2014; <cite>Raymond Luc Levasseur, an imate at ADX Florence from 1995 to 1999</cite></footer></blockquote><p>But that wasn&#x2019;t the case while Colorado was building up its rolodex of prisons in Fremont County, the Colorado county that incorporates Ca&#xF1;on City. The region is now nicknamed &#x201C;Prison Valley&#x201D; because of its enormous density of prisons &#x2014; over 11 state and federal prisons holding 7,500 inmates sit among among a population of 46,000 full-time residents.</p><p>Though Fremont County&#x2019;s first prison, the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/08/10/americas-cheeriest-prison-town-does-not-want-to-lock-more-people-up">opened</a> in Ca&#xF1;on City in 1871, most <a href="https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/hip/map/">were built</a> in the 1980s and 1990s at the height of contamination concerns. That means America&#x2019;s foremost prison town was built up in conjunction with &#x2014; and often without regard to &#x2014; widespread concerns about contamination in the environment around it.</p><p>To toxic prison activists like Panagioti Tsolkas, that&#x2019;s hardly surprising. &#x201C;I think [it&#x2019;s] the same reason why so many prisoners are not given the right to vote and held without any hope of parole,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because they&#x2019;re viewed as a subclass of the population, deserving of less basic rights, help, and protection.&#x201D;</p><iframe data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/OUT8383207099?" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe><p><em>Hear additional quotes from Richard Mosley and an extended interview with Michael Waters on <a href="../1359/the-outline-world-dispatch@zd=1&amp;zi=4ptctpam.html">The Outline World Dispatch</a>.
